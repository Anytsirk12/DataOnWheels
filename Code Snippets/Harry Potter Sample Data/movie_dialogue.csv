1,1,8,4,I should have known that you would be here...Professor McGonagall.
2,1,8,7,"Good evening, Professor Dumbledore. Are the rumours true, Albus?"
3,1,8,4,"I'm afraid so, Professor. The good, and the bad."
4,1,8,7,And the boy?
5,1,8,4,Hagrid is bringing him.
6,1,8,7,Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?
7,1,8,4,"Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life."
8,1,8,5,"Professor Dumbledore, Sir. Professor McGonagall."
9,1,8,4,"No problems, I trust, Hagrid?"
10,1,8,5,"No, sir. Little tyke fell asleep just as we were flying over Bristol. Heh. Try not to wake him. There you go."
11,1,8,7,"Albus, do you really think it's safe, leaving him with these people? I've watched them all day. They're the worst sort of Muggles imaginable. They really are..."
12,1,8,4,The only family he has.
13,1,8,7,This boy will be famous. There won't be a child in our world who doesn't know his name.
14,1,8,4,Exactly. He's better off growing up away from all that. Until he is ready.
15,1,8,4,"There, there, Hagrid. It's not really goodbye, after all."
16,1,8,4,Good luck...Harry Potter.
17,2,8,32,Up. Get up.  Now!
18,2,8,31,"Wake up, cousin! We're going to the zoo!"
19,2,8,32,"Oh, here he comes, the birthday boy!"
20,2,8,21,"Happy birthday, son."
21,2,8,32,"Why don't you just cook the breakfast, and try not to burn anything."
22,2,8,1,"Yes, Aunt Petunia."
23,2,8,32,I want everything to be perfect for my Dudley's special day.
24,2,8,21,"Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy!"
25,2,8,1,"Yes, Uncle Vernon."
26,2,8,32,"Aren't they wonderful, darling?"
27,2,8,31,How many are there?
28,2,8,21,Thirty-six. Counted 'em myself.
29,2,8,31,Thirty-six?! But last year last year I had thirty-seven!!
30,2,8,21,"Err yes, well, some of them are quite a bit bigger than last year."
31,2,8,31,I don't care how big they are!
32,2,8,32,"Oh, now, now, now. This is what we're going to do, is that when we go out, we're going to buy you two new presents! How's that, pumpkin?"
33,2,8,32,This will be a lovely day at the zoo. I'm really looking forward to it.
34,2,8,21,"I'm warning you now, boy. Any funny business, any at all, and you won't have any meals for a week. Get in."
35,2,8,31,Make it move.
36,2,8,21,Move!
37,2,8,31,MOVE!
38,2,8,1,He's asleep!
39,2,8,31,He's boring.
40,2,8,1,"Sorry about him. He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day, having people press their ugly faces in on you.  Can you...hear me?  It's just...I've never talked to a snake before. Do you...I mean...do you talk to people often?  You're from Burma, aren't you? Was it nice there, do you miss your family?  I see. That's me as well. I never knew my parents, either."
41,2,8,31,"Mummy, dad, come here! You won't believe what this snake is doing!"
42,2,8,31,Whoa! Ahh! Ahh!!
43,2,8,161,Thanks.
44,2,8,1,Anytime.
45,2,8,139,SNAKE!
46,2,8,31,"Mum, mummy!"
47,2,8,32,AHH!
48,2,8,31,"Mum, help! Help me!"
49,2,8,32,"My darling boy! How did you get in there?! How did you get in there? Dursley, oh, Dursley!"
50,3,8,32,It's all right. It's all right.
51,3,8,1,Ow!
52,3,8,21,What happened?!
53,3,8,1,"I swear I don't know!  One minute, the glass was there and then it was gone! It was like magic!"
54,3,8,21,There's no such thing as magic!
55,3,8,32,"Awww, smile.  Vernon, just look at him. I can't believe it. In just a week you'll be off to Smeltings."
56,3,8,21,Caveat Smeltona. Proudest moment of my life.
57,3,8,1,"Will I have to wear that, too?"
58,3,8,32,"What, you? Go to Smeltings?"
59,3,8,21,Ha!
60,3,8,32,"Oh, don't be so stupid, you're going to the state school where you belong.  And this is what you're gonna be wearing when I've finished dyeing it."
61,3,8,1,But that's Dudley's old uniform. It'll fit me like bits of old Elephant skin.
62,3,8,32,It'll fit you well enough. Go get the post.  Go!
63,3,8,21,"Oh, Marge is ill! Ate a funny whelk."
64,3,8,31,Dad! Look! Harry's got a letter!
65,3,8,1,"Hey, give it back! It's mine!"
66,3,8,21,Yours? Who'd be writing to you?
67,3,8,21,No more mail through this letterbox.
68,3,8,32,"Have a lovely day at the office, dear."
69,3,8,21,Shoo! Go on!
70,3,8,21,"Fine day Sunday. In my opinion, best day of the week. Why is that, Dudley?"
71,3,8,1,Because there's no post on Sunday?
72,3,8,21,"Ah, right you are, Harry. No post on Sunday. Ha! No blasted letters today. No, sir. Not one single bloody letter, not one.  No, sir, not one blasted, miserable-"
73,3,8,31,AHH! Make it stop! Please make it stop!
74,3,8,21,"Go away, ahh!"
75,3,8,31,What is it? Please tell me what's happening!
76,3,8,21,Give me that! Give me that letter!
77,3,8,1,Get off! Ahh!
78,3,8,21,Ahh!
79,3,8,1,They're my letters! Let go of me!
80,3,8,21,That's it! We're going away! Far away! Where they can't find us!
81,3,8,31,"Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?!"
82,4,10,1,"Make a wish, Harry."
83,4,10,21,Who's there? Ahh!
84,4,10,5,Sorry 'bout that.
85,4,10,21,"I demand that you leave at once, sir! You are breaking and entering!"
86,4,10,5,"Dry up, Dursley, you great prune.  Boy, I haven't seen you since you was a baby, Harry, but you're a bit more along than I would have expected. Particularly 'round the middle!"
87,4,10,31,I-I-I'm not Harry.
88,4,10,1,I-I am.
89,4,10,5,"Oh, well, of course you are! Got something for ya. 'Fraid I might have sat on it at some point! I imagine that it'll taste fine just the same. Ahh. Baked it myself.  Words and all. Heh."
90,4,10,1,Thank you!
91,4,10,5,"It's not every day that your young man turns eleven, now is it?"
92,4,10,1,"Excuse me, who are you?"
93,4,10,5,"Rubeus Hagrid. Keeper of keys and grounds at Hogwarts. Course, you'll know all about Hogwarts."
94,4,10,1,"Sorry, no."
95,4,10,5,"No? Blimey, Harry, didn't you ever wonder where your mum and dad learned it all?"
96,4,10,1,Learned what?
97,4,10,5,"You're a wizard, Harry."
98,4,10,1,I-I'm a what?
99,4,10,5,"A wizard. And a thumping good one at that, I'd wager. Once you train up a little."
100,4,10,1,"No, you've made a mistake. I can't be...a-a wizard. I mean, I'm just... Harry. Just Harry."
101,4,10,5,"Well, just Harry. Did you ever make anything happen? Anything you couldn't explain when you were angry or scared?  Ah."
102,4,10,1,"Dear, Mr. Potter. We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts' School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."
103,4,10,21,"He'll not be going! We swore when we took him in, we'd put a stop to this rubbish!"
104,4,10,1,You knew? You knew all along and you never told me?
105,4,10,32,"Of course we knew. How could you not be? My perfect sister being who she was. Oh, my mother and father were so proud the day she got her letter. We have a witch in the family. Isn't it wonderful? I was the only one to see her for what she was. A freak! And then she met that Potter, and then she had you, and I knew you'd be just the same, just as strange, just as ... abnormal. And then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up. And we got landed with you."
106,4,10,1,Blown up? You told me my parents died in a car crash!
107,4,10,5,A car crash? A car crash kill James and Lily Potter?
108,4,10,32,We had to tell him something.
109,4,10,5,It's an outrage! It's a scandal!
110,4,10,21,He'll not be going!
111,4,10,5,"Oh, and I suppose a great Muggle like yourself's going to stop him, are you?"
112,4,10,1,Muggle?
113,4,10,5,"Non magic folk.  This boy's had his name down ever since he was born!  He's going to the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world, and he'll be under the finest headmaster that Hogwarts has ever seen: Albus Dumbledore."
114,4,10,21,I will not pay for some crackpot old fool to teach him magic tricks!
115,4,10,5,"Never, insult Albus Dumbledore, in front of me."
116,4,10,31,Ahh!
117,4,10,5,"Oh, um, I'd appreciate if you didn't tell anyone at Hogwarts about that. Strictly speaking, I'm not allowed to do magic."
118,4,10,1,Okay.
119,4,10,5,"Ooh, we're a bit behind schedule. Best be off.  Unless you'd rather stay, of course. Hmm?"
120,5,5,1,"First year students will require: three sets of work robes, one wand."
121,5,5,5,"Essential bit of equipment, Harry."
122,5,5,1,"One pair of dragon-hide gloves.  Hagrid, do they mean for a real dragon?"
123,5,5,5,"Well, they don't mean for a penguin, do they? Heh. Crikey, but not a dragon."
124,5,5,1,But you like a dragon?
125,5,5,5,"Fast and misunderstood beasts, Harry. Fast and misunderstood."
126,5,5,1,"All students must be equipped with...one standard size two pewter cauldron and may bring if they desire either an owl, a cat or a toad. Could we find all this in London?"
127,5,5,5,If you know where to go.
128,5,5,92,"Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?"
129,5,5,5,"No thanks, Tom. I'm on official Hogwarts business today. Just helping young Harry here buy his school supplies."
130,5,5,92,Bless my soul. It's Harry Potter.
131,5,5,139,"Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back."
132,5,5,132,"Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter. I can't believe I'm meeting you at last."
133,5,5,41,Harry P-potter. C-can't tell you how pleased I am to meet you.
134,5,5,5,"Hello, Professor. I didn't see you there. Harry, this is Professor Quirrell. He'll be your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts."
135,5,5,1,"Oh, nice to meet you."
136,5,5,41,"F-fearfully fascinating subject. N-not that you need it, e-eh, Potter? Heheh."
137,5,5,5,"Yes, well, must be going now. Lots to buy. Heh."
138,5,5,1,Goodbye.
139,5,5,5,"See, Harry, you're famous!"
140,5,5,1,"But why am I famous, Hagrid? All those people back there, how is it they know who I am?"
141,5,5,5,"I'm not exactly sure I'm the right person to tell you that, Harry.  Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.  Here's where you'll get your quills and ink, and over there all your bits and bobs for doing your wizardry."
142,5,5,138,"It's a world class racing broom. Look at it, it's the new Nimbus 2000! It's the fastest model yet."
143,6,2,1,"But, Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this? I haven't any money."
144,6,2,5,"Well, there's your money, Harry.  Gringotts, the Wizard Bank. T'aint no place safer, 'cept perhaps Hogwarts."
145,6,2,1,"Uh, Hagrid, what exactly are these things?"
146,6,2,5,"They're goblins, Harry. Clever as they come goblins, but not the most friendly of beasts. Best stick close to me.  Mr. Harry Potter wishes to make a withdrawal."
147,6,2,130,And does Mr. Harry Potter have his key?
148,6,2,5,"Oh. Wait a minute. Got it here somewhere. Hah. There's the little devil.  Oh, and there's something else as well.  Professor Dumbledore gave me this.  It's about you-know-what in vault you-know-which."
149,6,2,130,Very well.
150,6,2,30,"Vault 687. Lamp, please.  Key please."
151,6,2,5,"Didn't think your mum and dad would leave you with nothing now, did ya?"
152,6,2,30,Vault 713.
153,6,2,1,"What's in there, Hagrid?"
154,6,2,5,"Can't tell you, Harry. It's Hogwarts business. Very secret."
155,6,2,30,Stand back.
156,6,2,5,"Best not mention this to anyone, Harry."
157,7,4,1,I still need...a wand.
158,7,4,5,"A wand? Well, you'll want Ollivanders.  No place better. Run along there, but wait. I just got one more thing I got to do. Won't be long."
159,7,4,1,Hello? Hello?
160,7,4,43,"I wondered when I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter. It seems only yesterday that your mother and father were in here buying their first wands.  Ah. Here we are.  Well, give it a wave.  Apparently not.  Perhaps this.  No, no, definitely not! No matter...  I wonder.  Curious, very curious."
161,7,4,1,"Sorry, but what's curious?"
162,7,4,43,"I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. It just so happens that the phoenix, whose tail feather resides in your wand gave one other feather, just one. It is curious that you should be destined for this wand when its brother gave you that scar."
163,7,4,1,And...who owned that wand?
164,7,4,43,"Oh, we do not speak his name. The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It's not always clear why, but I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things...terrible, yes, but great."
165,7,4,5,Harry! Harry! Happy birthday!
166,7,4,1,Wow.
167,8,5,5,"You all right, Harry? You seem very quiet."
168,8,5,1,"He killed my parents, didn't he? The one who gave me this. You know, Hagrid, I know you do."
169,8,5,5,"First, and understand this, Harry, 'cause it's very important. Not all wizards are good. Some of them go bad. A few years ago, there was one wizard who went as bad as you can go. And his name was V-...his name was V-..."
170,8,5,1,Maybe if you wrote it down?
171,8,5,5,"No, I can't spell it. All right.  Voldemort."
172,8,5,1,Voldemort?
173,8,5,5,Shh!!
174,8,5,5,"It was dark times, Harry, dark times.  Voldemort started to gather some followers, brought 'em over to the dark side. Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead. Your parents fought against him, but nobody lived once he decided to kill 'em.  Nobody...not one. Except you."
175,8,5,1,Me? Voldemort tried to kill...me?
176,8,5,5,"Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead, Harry. A mark like that only comes from being touched by a curse...and an evil curse at that."
177,8,5,1,What happened to...to You-Know-Who?
178,8,5,5,"Well, some say he died. Codswallop in my opinion. Nope, I reckon he's out there, still, too tired to go on. But one thing's absolutely certain. Something about you stumped him that night. That's why you're famous. That's why everybody knows your name. You're the boy who lived."
179,9,71,5,"What're you looking at?  Blimey, is that the time? Sorry, Harry, I'm gonna have to leave you. Dumbledore'll be wanting his- well, he'll be wanting to see me. Now, uh, your train leaves in 10 minutes. Here's your ticket.  Stick to it, Harry that's very important. Stick to your ticket."
180,9,71,1,"Platform 9&¾? But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake. This says Platform 9&¾. There's no such thing...is there?"
181,9,71,139,Sorry.
182,9,71,1,"Excuse me, excuse me."
183,9,71,149,"Right on your left, ma'am."
184,9,71,1,"Excuse me, sir. Can you tell me where I might find Platform 9&¾?"
185,9,71,149,"9&¾? Think you're being funny, do ya?"
186,9,71,26,"It's the same year after year. Always packed with Muggles, of course."
187,9,71,1,Muggles?
188,9,71,26,"Come on. Platform 9&¾ this way! All right, Percy, you first."
189,9,71,26,"Fred, you next."
190,9,71,19,"He's not Fred, I am!"
191,9,71,14,"Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother."
192,9,71,26,"Oh, I'm sorry, George."
193,9,71,14,I'm only joking. I am Fred.
194,9,71,1,Excuse me! C-could you tell me how to-
195,9,71,26,"How to get on the platform? Yes, not to worry, dear. It's Ron's first time to Hogwarts as well.  Now, all you've got to do is walk straight at the wall between platforms 9 and 10. Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous."
196,9,71,20,Good luck.
197,10,42,2,"Excuse me, do you mind? Everywhere else is full."
198,10,42,1,"No, not at all."
199,10,42,2,"I'm Ron, by the way. Ron Weasley."
200,10,42,1,I'm Harry. Harry Potter.
201,10,42,2,"So-so it's true? I mean, do you really have the...the..."
202,10,42,1,The what?
203,10,42,2,Scar...?
204,10,42,1,Oh
205,10,42,2,Wicked.
206,10,42,140,"Anything off the trolley, dears?"
207,10,42,2,"No, thanks, I'm all set."
208,10,42,1,We'll take the lot!
209,10,42,2,Whoa!
210,10,42,1,Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans?
211,10,42,2,"They mean every flavour! There's chocolate and peppermint, and there's also spinach, liver and tripe. George sweared he got a bogey-flavoured one once!"
212,10,42,1,"These aren't real chocolate frogs, are they?"
213,10,42,2,"It's just a spell. Besides, it's the cards you want. Each pack's got a famous witch or wizard. I got about 500 meself.  Watch it!  Oh, that's rotten luck. They've only got one good jump in them to begin with."
214,10,42,1,I got Dumbledore!
215,10,42,2,I got about 6 of him.
216,10,42,1,"Hey, he's gone!"
217,10,42,2,"Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you?  This is Scabbers, by the way, pathetic, isn't he?"
218,10,42,1,A little.
219,10,42,2,Fred gave me a spell as to turn him yellow. Want to see?
220,10,42,1,Yeah!
221,10,42,2,Ahem. Sun-
222,10,42,3,Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville's lost one.
223,10,42,2,No.
224,10,42,3,"Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then."
225,10,42,2,"Sunshine, daises, butter mellow, turn this stupid fat rat yellow!"
226,10,42,3,"Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? Of course I've only tried a few simple spells myself, and they've all worked for me. For example...  Oculus Reparo.  That's better, isn't it? Holy Cricket, you're Harry Potter. I'm Hermione Granger...and you are...?"
227,10,42,2,I'm...Ron Weasley.
228,10,42,3,"Pleasure. You two better change into your robes. I expect we'll be arriving soon.  You've got dirt, on your nose, by the way, did you know? Just there."
229,11,33,5,"Right, then! First years! This way, please! Come on, now, don't be shy! Come on now, hurry up!"
230,11,33,5,"Hello, Harry."
231,11,33,1,"Hey, Hagrid."
232,11,33,2,Whoaa!
233,11,33,5,"Right then. This way to the boats! Come on, now, follow me."
234,11,33,2,Wicked.
235,11,33,7,"Welcome to Hogwarts. Now, in a few moments, you will pass through these doors and join your classmates. But before you can take your seats, you must be sorted into your houses. They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Now while you're here, your house will be like your family. Your triumphs will earn you house points. Any rule breaking, and you will lose points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup."
236,11,33,10,Trevor!  Sorry.
237,11,33,7,The sorting ceremony will begin momentarily.
238,11,33,12,"It's true then, what they're saying on the train. Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.  This is Crabbe and Goyle. And I'm Malfoy...Draco Malfoy.  Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask yours. Red hair, and a hand-me-down robe? You must be a Weasley. Well, soon find that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. Don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there."
239,11,33,1,"I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks."
240,11,33,7,We're ready for you now. Follow me.
241,12,36,3,"It's not real, the ceiling. It's just bewitched to look like the night sky. I read about it in Hogwarts: A History."
242,12,36,7,"Will you wait along here, please? Now, before we begin, Professor Dumbledore would like to say a few words."
243,12,36,4,"I have a few start of term notices I wish to announce. The first years please note that the dark forest is strictly forbidden to all students. Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch  has asked me to remind you that the 3rd floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death. Thank you."
244,12,36,7,"When I call your name, you will come forth, I shall place the sorting hat on your head, and you will be sorted into your houses. Hermione Granger."
245,12,36,3,"Oh, no. Okay, relax."
246,12,36,2,"Mental that one, I'm telling you."
247,12,36,128,"Ah, right then...hmm...right. Okay...Gryffindor!!"
248,12,36,7,Draco Malfoy.
249,12,36,128,SLYTHERIN!
250,12,36,2,There isn't a witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin.
251,12,36,7,Susan Bones.
252,12,36,1,Ahh!
253,12,36,2,"Harry, what is it?"
254,12,36,1,"Nothing... nothing, I'm fine."
255,12,36,128,Let's see...I know...Hufflepuff!
256,12,36,7,Ronald Weasley.
257,12,36,128,Ha! Another Weasley. I know just what to do with you... Gryffindor!!
258,12,36,7,Harry Potter.
259,12,36,128,"Hmm...difficult, very difficult. Plenty of courage I see, not a bad mind, either. There's talent, oh yes, and a thirst to prove yourself. But where to put you?"
260,12,36,1,Not Slytherin. Not Slytherin.
261,12,36,128,"Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure? You could be great, you know. It's all here in your head. And Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness! There's no doubt about that. No?"
262,12,36,1,Not Slytherin...anything but Slytherin.
263,12,36,128,"Well, if you're sure... better be... GRYFFINDOR!!"
264,12,36,14,We got Potter! We got Potter!
265,12,36,19,We got Potter! We got Potter!
266,13,36,7,"Your attention, please."
267,13,36,4,Let the feast...begin.
268,13,36,1,Wow.
269,13,36,29,I'm half and half. Me dad's a Muggle. Mam's a witch. Bit of a nasty shock for him when he found out.
270,13,36,1,"Say, Percy, who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?"
271,13,36,37,"Oh, that's Professor Snape, head of Slytherin house."
272,13,36,1,What's he teach?
273,13,36,37,Potions. But everyone knows it's the Dark Arts he fancies. He's been after Quirrell's job for years.
274,13,36,2,Ahh!
275,13,36,47,Hello! How are you? Welcome to Gryffindor.
276,13,36,117,Whoo-hoo-hoo!
277,13,36,134,"Look, it's the Bloody Baron!"
278,13,36,37,"Hello, Sir Nicholas. Have a nice summer?"
279,13,36,47,"Dismal. Once again, my request to join the headless hunt has been denied."
280,13,36,2,I know you! You're Nearly Headless Nick!
281,13,36,47,I prefer Sir Nicholas if you don't mind.
282,13,36,3,Nearly headless? How can you be nearly headless?
283,13,36,47,Like this.
284,13,36,2,Ahh!
285,13,36,37,"Gryffindors, follow me, please. Keep up. Thank you."
286,13,36,138,"Ravenclaws, follow me. This way."
287,13,28,37,"This is the most direct path to the dormitories. Oh, and keep an eye on the staircases...they like to change."
288,13,28,37,"Keep up, please, and follow me. Quickly now, come on. Come on."
289,13,28,10,"Seamus, that picture's moving!"
290,13,28,2,"Look at that one, Harry!"
291,13,28,1,I think she fancies you.
292,13,28,134,"Oh, look! Look! Who's that girl?"
293,13,28,150,Welcome to Hogwarts.
294,13,28,134,Who's that?
295,13,28,141,Password?
296,13,28,37,"Caput Draconis.  Follow me, everyone. Keep up, quickly, come on."
297,13,39,134,"Oh, wow."
298,13,39,37,"Gather 'round here. Welcome to the Gryffindor Common Room. Boy's dormitories, upstairs and down to your left. Girls, the same on your right. You'll find that your belongings have already been brought up."
299,14,61,2,"Whew, we made it. Can you imagine the look on McGonagall's face if we were late?"
300,14,61,2,That was bloody brilliant.
301,14,61,7,"Thank you for that assessment, Mr. Weasley. Perhaps if I were to transfigure Mr. Potter and yourself into a pocketwatch, that way one of you might be on time."
302,14,61,1,We got lost.
303,14,61,7,Then perhaps a map? I trust you don't need one to find your seats.
304,14,49,6,"There will be no foolish wand waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion making. However, for those select few...  who possess the predisposition, I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory and even put a stopper...  in death.  Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confidant enough to not...pay...attention.  Mr. Potter. Our...new...celebrity. Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?  You don't know? Well, let's try again. Where, Mr. Potter, would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar?"
305,14,49,1,"I don't know, sir."
306,14,49,6,And what is the difference between monkshood and wolfbane?
307,14,49,1,"I don't know, sir."
308,14,49,6,"Pity. Clearly, fame isn't everything...  is it, Mr. Potter?"
309,14,49,1,"Clearly, Hermione knows. Since it's a pity not to ask her."
310,14,49,6,"Silence.  And put her hand down, you silly girl.  For your information, Potter... asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful, it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite.  Well?  Why aren't you all copying this down?  And Gryffindors, note that five points, will be taken from your house... for your classmate's cheek."
311,14,36,29,"Eye of rabbit, harp string hum. Turn this water, into rum.  Eye of rabbit, harp string hum..."
312,14,36,1,What's Seamus trying to do to that glass of water?
313,14,36,2,"Turn it into rum. Actually managed a weak tea yesterday, before-"
314,14,36,2,Ah. Mail's here!
315,14,36,1,Can I borrow this?  Thanks.
316,14,36,29,"Hey, look! Neville's got a Remembrall!"
317,14,36,3,"I've read about those. When the smoke turns red,  it means you've forgotten something."
318,14,36,10,"The only problem is, I can't remember what I've forgotten."
319,14,36,1,"Hey, Ron, somebody broke into Gringotts, listen.  Believed to be the work of dark witches or wizards unknown, Gringotts goblins, while acknowledging the breach, insist that nothing was taken. The vault in question, number 713, had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. That's odd. That's the vault Hagrid and I went to."
320,15,52,50,"Good afternoon, class."
321,15,52,154,"Good afternoon, Madam Hooch."
322,15,52,50,"Good afternoon, Amanda, good afternoon.  Welcome to your first flying lesson. Well, what are you waiting for? Everyone step up to the left side of their broomstick. Come on now, hurry up. Stick your right hand over the broom and say, up!"
323,15,52,154,Up!
324,15,52,1,Wow.
325,15,52,12,Up!
326,15,52,50,With feeling!
327,15,52,3,Up. Up. Up. Up.
328,15,52,2,"Up!!  Ooh!  Shut up, Harry."
329,15,52,50,"Now, once you've got hold of your broom, I want you to mount it. And grip it tight, you don't want to be sliding off the end.  When I blow my whistle, I want each of you to kick off from the ground, hard. Keep your broom steady, hover for a moment, and then lean forward slightly and touch back down. On my whistle...3...2..."
330,15,52,10,Oh...
331,15,52,50,Mr. Longbottom.
332,15,52,134,"Neville, what are you doing?"
333,15,52,127,Neville...Neville...
334,15,52,138,"We're not supposed to take off, yet."
335,15,52,50,M-M-Mr. Longbottom! Mr. Longbottom!
336,15,52,10,AHH!
337,15,52,50,Mr. Longbottom!
338,15,52,10,Down! Down! Ahhhh!
339,15,52,1,Neville!
340,15,52,10,Help!!!
341,15,52,50,Come back down this instant!
342,15,52,10,AHH!
343,15,52,10,Help!
344,15,52,50,Mr. Longbottom-!
345,15,52,10,Ahhhh! Whoa! Ahhh!  Oh. Ah...help!  Ahh!
346,15,52,50,"Everyone out of the way!  Come on, get up."
347,15,52,134,Is he alright?
348,15,52,10,Owowowow.
349,15,52,50,"Oh, oh, oh, oh dear. It's a broken wrist. Tch, tch, tch. Good boy, come on now, up you get.  Everyone's to keep their feet firmly on the ground while I take Mr. Longbottom to the hospital wing. Understand? If I see a single broom in the air, the one riding it will find themselves out of Hogwarts before they can say, Quidditch."
350,15,52,12,"Did you see his face? Maybe if the fat lump had given this a squeeze, he'd have remembered to fall on his fat arse."
351,15,52,1,"Give it here, Malfoy."
352,15,52,12,"No. I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find.  How 'bout up on the roof?  What's the matter, Potter? Bit beyond your reach?"
353,15,52,3,"Harry, no way! You heard what Madam Hooch said! Besides, you don't even know how to fly.  What an idiot."
354,15,52,1,"Give it here, Malfoy, or I'll knock you off your broom!"
355,15,52,12,"Is that so?  Have it your way, then!"
356,15,52,138,"Good job, Harry!"
357,15,52,163,"Oh, that was wicked, Harry."
358,15,52,7,Harry Potter?  Follow me.
359,15,30,41,An iguana s-such as this is...
360,15,30,7,You wait here.
361,15,30,41,... an essential in-gredient.
362,15,30,7,"Professor Quirrell, excuse me, excuse me. Could I borrow Wood for a moment, please?"
363,15,30,41,"Oh. Y-yes, of course.  And the vampire b-bat..."
364,15,30,7,"Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood, I have found you a Seeker!"
365,15,63,47,Have you heard? Harry Potter's the new Gryffindor Seeker. I always knew he'd do well.
366,15,63,2,Seeker? But first years never make their house teams! You must be the youngest Quidditch player in...
367,15,63,1,"A century, according to McGonagall."
368,15,63,14,"Hey, well done, Harry, Wood's just told us!"
369,15,63,2,"Fred and George are on the team, too. Beaters."
370,15,63,19,"Our job is to make sure that you don't get bloodied up too bad. Can't make any promises, of course. Rough game, Quidditch."
371,15,63,14,Brutal. But no one's died in years. Someone will vanish occasionally...
372,15,63,19,But they'll turn up in a month or two!
373,15,63,2,"Oh, go on, Harry, Quidditch is great. Best game there is! And you'll be great, too!"
374,15,63,1,But I've never even played Quidditch. What if I make a fool of myself?
375,15,63,3,You won't make a fool of yourself. It's in your blood.
376,15,63,2,"Whoa. Harry, you never told me your father was a Seeker, too."
377,15,63,1,I-I didn't know.
378,16,59,2,"I'm telling you, it's spooky. She knows more about you than you do."
379,16,59,1,Who doesn't?
380,16,59,2,Ahh!
381,16,59,1,What's happening?
382,16,59,3,"The staircases change, remember?"
383,16,59,1,Let's go this way.
384,16,59,2,Before the staircase moves again.
385,16,59,1,Does anyone feel like...we shouldn't be here?
386,16,59,3,We're not supposed to be here. This is the 3rd floor. It's forbidden.
387,16,59,1,Let's go.
388,16,59,2,It's Filch's cat!
389,16,59,1,Run!
390,16,59,1,Quick! Let's hide though that door!
391,16,59,1,It's locked!
392,16,59,2,"That's it, we're done for!"
393,16,59,3,"Oh, move over!  Alohomora.  Get in."
394,16,59,2,Alohomora?
395,16,59,3,"Standard book of spells, Chapter 7."
396,16,59,35,"Anyone here, my sweet?  Come on."
397,16,59,3,Filch is gone.
398,16,59,2,Probably thinks this door's locked.
399,16,59,3,It was locked.
400,16,59,1,And for good reason.
401,16,59,136,AHHHHHHH!
402,16,59,2,What do they think they're doing?? Keeping a thing like that locked up in a school.
403,16,59,3,"You don't use your eyes, do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on?"
404,16,59,2,"I wasn't looking at its feet! I was a bit preoccupied with its heads. Or maybe you didn't notice, there were three!"
405,16,59,3,It was standing on a trap door. Which means it wasn't there by accident. It's guarding something.
406,16,59,1,Guarding something?
407,16,59,3,"That's right. Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed... or worse, expelled!"
408,16,59,2,She needs to sort out her priorities!
409,17,52,46,"Quidditch is easy enough to understand. Each time has seven players, 3 chasers, 2 beaters, 1 keeper and a seeker. That's you. There are three kinds of balls.  This one's called the Quaffle. Now, the chasers handle the Quaffle and try to put it through one of those three hoops.  The keeper, that's me, defends the hoops.  With me so far?"
410,17,52,1,I think so. What are those?
411,17,52,46,"You better take this.  Careful now, it's comin' back.  Eh, not bad, Potter, you'd make a fair beater... Uh-oh."
412,17,52,1,What is that?
413,17,52,46,"Bludger. Nasty little buggers. But you are the seeker, and the only thing I want you to worry about is this... the Golden Snitch."
414,17,52,1,I like this ball.
415,17,52,46,"Ah, you like it now. Just wait. It's wicked fast and damn near impossible to see."
416,17,52,1,What do I do with it?
417,17,52,46,"You catch it... before the other team's seeker. You catch this, the game is over. You catch this, Potter, and we win."
418,17,52,1,Whoa.
419,17,26,59,"One of a wizard's most rudimentary skills is levitation the ability to make objects fly. Uh, do you all have your feathers?  Good. Now, uh, don't forget the nice wrist movement we've been practicing, hmm? The swish and flick. Everyone."
420,17,26,136,The swish and flick.
421,17,26,59,Good. And enunciate. Wingardium Leviosa. Off you go then.
422,17,26,12,Wingardium Levio-saaa.
423,17,26,2,Wingardrium Leviosar!
424,17,26,3,"Stop, stop, stop. You're going to take someone's eye out. Besides, you're saying it wrong. It's Levi-o-sa, not Leviosar."
425,17,26,2,"You do it then if you're so clever. Go on, go on."
426,17,26,3,Wingardium Leviosa.
427,17,26,59,"Oh, well done! See here, everyone! Ms. Granger's done it! Oh, splendid!"
428,17,26,29,Wingard Levosa.
429,17,26,59,"Well done, dear."
430,17,26,59,Whooaaa! Ooh.
431,17,26,1,"I think we're going to need another feather over here, Professor."
432,17,36,2,"It's Levioooosa, not Leviosaaaar.  She's a nightmare, honestly. No wonder she hasn't got any friends!"
433,17,36,1,I think she heard you.
434,18,36,1,Where's Hermione?
435,18,36,10,Parvati Patil said that she wouldn't come out of the girl's bathroom. She said that she'd been in there all afternoon...crying.
436,18,36,41,TROLL! IN THE DUNGEON! T-TROOLLL IN THE DUNGEON!!  Thought you ought to know.
437,18,36,4,"SILLLLLEEENNNNCEEEEE!  Everyone will please, not panic. Now, Prefects will lead their houses back to the dormitories. Teachers will follow me to the dungeons."
438,18,36,134,"Hufflepuff, this way!"
439,18,36,138,Stay together!
440,18,36,37,"Gryffindors, keep up please. And stay alert!"
441,18,36,1,How could a troll get in?
442,18,36,2,Not by itself. Trolls are really stupid. Probably people playing jokes.  What?
443,18,36,1,Hermione! She doesn't know!
444,18,34,2,I think the troll's left the dungeon!
445,18,34,1,It's going into the Girl's Bathroom!
446,18,34,1,"Hermione, move!"
447,18,34,3,Help! Help!
448,18,34,2,"Hey, pea brain!"
449,18,34,3,Ahhh! Help!
450,18,34,1,"Whooa! Whoa, whoa!"
451,18,34,2,Ew.
452,18,34,1,"Whoa, whoa whoa!"
453,18,34,1,Do something!
454,18,34,2,What?
455,18,34,1,Anything! Hurry up!
456,18,34,3,Swish and flick!
457,18,34,2,Wingardium Leviosa!  Cool.
458,18,34,3,Is it...dead?
459,18,34,1,I don't think so. Just knocked out.  Ew. Troll bogies.
460,18,34,7,"Oh! Oh, my goodness! E-Explain yourselves, both of you!"
461,18,34,2,"Well, what it is..."
462,18,34,1,"Well, what it is..."
463,18,34,3,"It's my fault, Professor McGonagall."
464,18,34,7,Miss Granger?
465,18,34,3,I went looking for the troll. I'd read about them and thought I could handle it. But I was wrong. If Harry and Ron hadn't come and found me...I'd probably be dead.
466,18,34,7,"Be that as it may be...it was an extremely foolish thing to do.  I would have expected more rational behavior on your part, Miss Granger. Five points will be taken from Gryffindor for your serious lack of judgment.  As for you two gentlemen I just hope you realize how fortunate you are. Not many students could take on a fully grown mountain troll and live to tell the tale. Five points...will be awarded to each of you.  For sheer dumb luck."
467,18,34,41,Perhaps you ought to go...M-might wake up...heh.  Ahh! Hehe....
468,18,34,1,Good for you to get us out of trouble like that.
469,18,34,2,"Mind you, I mean, we did save her life."
470,18,34,1,"Mind you, she didn't need saving if you hadn't insulted her."
471,18,34,2,What are friends for?
472,19,36,2,"Take a bit of toast, mate, go on."
473,19,36,3,"Ron's right, Harry. You're gonna need your strength today."
474,19,36,1,I'm not hungry.
475,19,36,6,"Good luck today, Potter. Then again, now that you've proven yourself against a troll, a little game of Quidditch should be easy work for you...even if it is against Slytherin."
476,19,36,1,That explains the blood.
477,19,36,3,Blood?
478,19,36,1,"Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog. But, he got himself bitten, that's why he's limping."
479,19,36,3,But why would anyone go near that dog?
480,19,36,1,"The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults. He said it was Hogwarts' business, very secret."
481,19,36,3,So you're saying...
482,19,36,1,That's what the dog's guarding. That's what Snape wants.
483,19,36,3,"Bit early for mail, isn't it?"
484,19,36,1,But I-I never get mail.
485,19,36,2,Let's open it.
486,19,36,1,It's a broomstick!
487,19,36,2,"Thats not just any broomstick, Harry.  It's a Nimbus 2000!"
488,19,36,1,But who...?
489,19,51,46,"Scared, Harry?"
490,19,51,1,A little.
491,19,51,46,That's all right. I felt the same way before my first game.
492,19,51,1,What happened?
493,19,51,46,"Er, I don't really remember. I took a bludger to the head 2 minutes in. Woke up in the hospital a week later."
494,19,51,52,"Hello, and welcome to Hogwarts' first Quidditch game of the season! Today's game Slytherin versus Gryffindor!!!"
495,19,51,10,Gryffindor!
496,19,51,52,The players take their positions as Madam Hooch steps out onto the field to begin the game.
497,19,51,50,"Now, I want a nice clean game...from all of you."
498,19,51,52,"The bludgers are up...followed by the Golden Snitch. Remember, the snitch is worth 150 points. The seeker who catches the Snitch ends the game."
499,19,51,52,The Quaffle is released...and the game begins!
500,19,51,52,Angelina Johnson scores! 10 points for Gryffindor!
501,19,51,1,Yes!  Whoa!
502,19,51,5,Well done!
503,19,51,52,Slytherin takes possession of the Quaffle. Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.
504,19,51,2,Yay!
505,19,51,29,Yay!
506,19,51,1,Yes!
507,19,51,52,Another 10 points to Gryffindor!
508,19,51,165,Yay!
509,19,51,82,Give me that!
510,19,51,82,Take that side!
511,20,51,1,Whoa! Whooa!
512,20,51,5,What's going on with Harry's broomstick?
513,20,51,3,It's Snape! He's jinxing the broom!
514,20,51,2,Jinxing the broom? What do we do?
515,20,51,3,Leave it to me.
516,20,51,2,"Come on, Hermione!"
517,20,51,3,Lacarnum Inflamarae.
518,20,51,139,Fire! You're on fire!
519,20,51,6,What? Oh!
520,20,51,2,Go!
521,20,51,5,Go go go!
522,20,51,5,Looks like he's gonna be sick!
523,20,51,52,He's got the Snitch! Harry Potter receives 150 points for catching the Snitch!
524,20,51,50,Gryffindor win!
525,20,51,12,No!
526,20,51,5,Yes!
527,20,51,3,Whoo-hoo!
528,20,51,164,Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor!
529,21,40,5,Nonsense! Why would Snape put a curse on Harry's broom?
530,21,40,1,Who knows? Why was he trying to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween?
531,21,40,5,Who told you about Fluffy?
532,21,40,2,Fluffy?
533,21,40,3,That thing has a name?
534,21,40,5,"Well, of course he's got a name. He's mine. I bought him off an Irish feller I met down at the pub last year. Then I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the.."
535,21,40,1,Yes?
536,21,40,5,"Shouldn't have said that. No more questions! Don't ask any more questions. That's top secret, that is."
537,21,40,1,"But, Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it."
538,21,40,5,Codswallop. Professor Snape is a Hogwarts teacher.
539,21,40,3,"Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a spell when I see one. I've read all about them. You've got to keep eye contact and Snape wasn't blinking."
540,21,40,1,Exactly.
541,21,40,5,"Now, you listen to me, all three of you. You're meddling in things that ought not to be meddled in. It's dangerous. What that dog is guarding is strictly between Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel."
542,21,40,1,Nicholas Flamel?
543,21,40,5,I shouldn't said that. I should not have said that.
544,21,40,1,Nicholas Flamel.  Who's Nicholas Flamel?
545,21,40,3,I don't know.
546,21,39,158,Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Ring the Hogwart bell. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas...
547,21,39,1,Knight to E5.
548,21,39,2,Queen to E5.
549,21,39,3,That's totally barbaric!
550,21,39,2,That's wizard's chess.  I see you've packed.
551,21,39,3,See you haven't.
552,21,39,2,"Change of plans, my parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother Charlie. He's studying dragons there."
553,21,39,3,"Good, you can help Harry, then. He's going to go and look in the library for information on Nicholas Flamel."
554,21,39,2,We've looked a hundred times.
555,21,39,3,Not in the restricted section. Happy Christmas.
556,21,39,2,I think we've had a bad influence on her.
557,21,39,2,"Harry wake up! Come on Harry, wake up!"
558,21,39,2,"Happy Christmas, Harry."
559,21,39,1,"Happy Christmas, Ron.  What are you wearing?"
560,21,39,2,Oh. My mum made it.  It looks like you've got one too.
561,21,39,1,I-I've got presents?
562,21,39,2,Yeah!
563,21,39,2,There they are.
564,21,39,1,Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well.
565,21,39,2,What is it?
566,21,39,1,It's some kind of cloak.
567,21,39,2,"Well, let's see then, put it on."
568,21,39,2,Whoa!
569,21,39,1,My body's gone!
570,21,39,2,I know what that is. That's an invisibility cloak.
571,21,39,1,I'm invisible?
572,21,39,2,They're really rare.  I wonder who gave it to you?
573,21,39,1,There was no name. It just said use it well.
574,22,54,1,Famous fire eaters...15th Century Fiends...Flamel...Nicholas Flamel...where are you?
575,22,54,35,Who's there?!  I know you're in there. You can't hide.  Who is it? Show yourself!
576,22,54,41,Severus...I-I thought...
577,22,54,6,"You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell."
578,22,54,41,W-what do you m-mean?
579,22,54,6,You know perfectly well what I mean.  We'll have another chat soon...when you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie.
580,22,54,35,"Oh, Professors. I found this, in the Restricted Section. It's still hot. That means there's a student out of bed."
581,23,65,1,Mum?  Dad?
582,23,65,1,"Ron! You've really got to see this! Ron! You've got to see this!  Ron, Ron, come on. Get out of bed!"
583,23,65,2,Why?
584,23,65,1,"There's something you've got to see. Now, come on!"
585,23,65,1,"Come on. Come. Come look, it's my parents!"
586,23,65,2,I only see me.
587,23,65,1,"Look in properly. Go on. Stand there. There. You see them, don't you? Thats my dad"
588,23,65,2,"That's me! Only, I'm head boy...and I'm holding the Quidditch cup! And bloody hell, I'm Quidditch Captain too! I look good. Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?"
589,23,65,1,How can it? Both my parents are dead.
590,23,65,19,"Do you like yours, Ron?  Ron?"
591,23,65,2,I'll be right back.  Want to play chess?
592,23,65,1,No.
593,23,65,2,We go and visit Hagrid?
594,23,65,1,No.
595,23,65,2,"Harry, I know what you're thinking, but don't. There's something not quite right about that mirror."
596,23,65,4,"Back again, Harry?  I see that you, like so many before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. I trust by now you realize what it does. Let me give you a clue. The happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself, exactly as he is."
597,23,65,1,"So, then it shows us what we want? Whatever we want?"
598,23,65,4,"Yes...and no. It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desires of our hearts. Now you, who have never known your family, you see them standing beside you. But remember this, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away in front of it, even gone mad. That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home, and I must ask you not to go looking for it again. It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry, and forget to live."
599,24,44,1,"Hi, Hedwig."
600,24,44,3,Look at you playing with your cards. Pathetic! We've got final exams coming up soon.
601,24,44,2,I'm ready! Ask me any question.
602,24,44,3,"All right, what are the three most crucial ingredients in a Forgetfulness Potion?"
603,24,44,2,...I forgot.
604,24,44,3,"And what, may I ask, do you plan to do if this comes up in the final exam?"
605,24,44,2,Copy off you?
606,24,44,3,"No, you won't! Besides, according to Professor McGonagall, we're to be given special quills bewitched with an anti-cheating spell."
607,24,44,2,That's insulting! It's as if they don't trust us!  Dumbledore again!
608,24,44,2,Leg-Locker Curse?
609,24,44,1,Malfoy.
610,24,44,2,"You have got to start standing up to people, Neville."
611,24,44,10,How? I can barely stand at all!
612,24,44,29,I'll do the counter-curse!
613,24,44,10,"No, that's all I need... you to set my bloody kneecaps on fire!"
614,24,44,29,"I don't appreciate the insinuation, Longbottom. Besides, if anyone cares to notice, my eyebrows have completely grown back!"
615,24,44,1,I found him!
616,24,44,2,Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark Wizard Grindelwald in 1945
617,24,44,1,Go on.
618,24,44,2,"-for his discovery of the 12 uses of Dragon Blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner Nicolas Flamel!"
619,24,44,1,I knew the name sounded familiar. I read it on the train that day.
620,24,44,3,Follow me!
621,24,44,10,"Hey, wait, where are you going? What about the counter-curse?!"
622,24,44,3,I had you looking in the wrong section! How could I be so stupid? I checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading.
623,24,44,2,This is light?
624,24,44,3,"Of course! Here it is!  ""Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone!"""
625,24,44,2,The what?
626,24,44,1,The what?
627,24,44,3,"Honestly, don't you two read? ""The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. It will turn any metal into pure gold and produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal."""
628,24,44,2,Immortal?
629,24,44,3,It means you'll never die.
630,24,44,2,I know what it means!
631,24,44,1,Shh!
632,24,44,3,"""The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel, the noted alchemist, who last year celebrated his 665th birthday!"" That's what Fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor. That's what's under the trapdoor...the Philosopher's Stone!"
633,24,40,1,Hagrid!
634,24,40,5,"Oh, hello. Sorry, don't wish to be rude, but I'm in no fit state to entertain today."
635,24,40,1,We know about the Philosopher's Stone!
636,24,40,3,We know about the Philosopher's Stone!
637,24,40,2,We know about the Philosopher's Stone!
638,24,40,5,Oh.
639,24,40,1,We think Snape's trying to steal it.
640,24,40,5,"Snape? Blimey, Harry, you're not still on about him, are you?"
641,24,40,1,"Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone. We just don't know why."
642,24,40,5,Snape is one of the teachers protecting the Stone! He's not about to steal it!
643,24,40,1,What?
644,24,40,5,"You heard. Right. Come on, now, I'm a bit preoccupied today."
645,24,40,1,Wait a minute.  One of the teachers?
646,24,40,3,"Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there? Spells, enchantments."
647,24,40,5,"That's right. Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.  Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy. Hehe, not a soul knows how. Except for me and Dumbledore. I shouldn't have told you that. I shouldn't have told you that.  Oh!  Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!"
648,24,40,1,"Uh, Hagrid, what exactly is that?"
649,24,40,5,That? It's a ... its um...
650,24,40,2,"I know what that is! But Hagrid, how did you get one?"
651,24,40,5,"I won it. Off a stranger I met down at a pub. Seemed quite glad to be rid off it, as a matter of fact."
652,24,40,3,Is that...a dragon?
653,24,40,2,That's not just a dragon. That's a Norwegian Ridgeback! My brother Charlie works with these in Romania.
654,24,40,5,"Isn't he beautiful? Oh. Bless him, look. He knows his mummy. Hehe. Hallo, Norbert."
655,24,40,1,Norbert?
656,24,40,5,"Yeah, well, he's got to have a name, doesn't he?  Don't you, Norbert?  Dededede."
657,24,40,5,"Ohh!  Oooh, ooh, ooh, well...he'll have to be trained up a bit, of course.  Who's that?"
658,24,40,1,Malfoy.
659,24,40,5,"Oh, dear."
660,24,40,1,Hagrid always wanted a dragon. He told me so the first time I met him.
661,24,40,2,"It's crazy. And worse, Malfoy knows."
662,24,40,1,I don't understand. Is that bad?
663,24,40,2,It's bad.
664,24,40,7,Good evening.
665,24,40,7,"Nothing, I repeat, nothing gives a student the right to walk about the school at night. Therefore, as punishment for your actions, 50 points will be taken."
666,24,40,1,50?!
667,24,40,7,"Each.  And to ensure it doesn't happen again, all four of you will receive detention."
668,24,40,12,"Excuse me, Professor. Perhaps I heard you wrong. I thought you said...""the four of us."""
669,24,40,7,"No, you heard me correctly, Mr. Malfoy. You see, as honorable as your intentions were, you too were out of bed after hours. You will serve detention with your classmates."
670,25,35,35,"A pity they let the old punishments die. There was a time detention would find you hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons. God, I miss the screaming.  You'll be serving detention with Hagrid tonight. He's got a little job to do inside the dark forest.  A sorry lot this, Hagrid. Oh, good God, man, you're not still on about that bloody dragon, are you?"
671,25,35,5,Norbert's gone. Dumbledore sent him off to Romania to live in a colony.
672,25,35,3,"Well, that's good, isn't it? He'll be with his own kind."
673,25,35,5,"Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania?  What if the other dragons are mean to him? He's only a baby, after all."
674,25,35,35,"Oh, for Gods sake, pull yourself together, man. You're going into the forest, after all. Got to have your wits about you."
675,25,35,12,The forest? I thought that was a joke! We can't go in there. Students aren't allowed. And there are......werewolves!
676,25,35,35,"There's more than werewolves in those trees, lad. You can be sure of that.  Nighty-night."
677,25,35,5,Right. Let's go.
678,25,35,1,"Hagrid, what's that?"
679,25,35,5,"What we're here for. See that? That's unicorn's blood, that is. I found one dead a few weeks ago. Now, this one's been injured bad by something.  So, it's our job to find the poor beast. Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me."
680,25,35,2,Okay.
681,25,35,5,"And Harry, you'll go with Malfoy."
682,25,35,12,Okay. Then I get Fang!
683,25,35,5,"Fine. Just so you know, he's a bloody coward."
684,25,35,12,You wait till my father hears about this. This is servant's stuff.
685,25,35,1,"If I didn't know better, Draco, I'd say you were scared."
686,25,35,12,"Scared, Potter?!  Did you hear that? Come on, Fang. Scared."
687,25,35,1,"What is it, Fang?"
688,25,35,12,HELP!!!!!
689,25,35,87,"Harry Potter, you must leave. You are known to many creatures here. The forest is not safe at this time. Especially for you."
690,25,35,1,But what was that thing you saved me from?
691,25,35,87,"A monstrous creature. It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn. Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death. But at a terrible price. You have slain something so pure that the moment the blood touches your lips, you will have a half-life. A cursed life."
692,25,35,1,But who would choose such a life?
693,25,35,87,Can you think of no one?
694,25,35,1,Do you mean to say...that that thing that killed the unicorn...that was drinking its blood...that was Voldemort?
695,25,35,87,Do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?
696,25,35,1,The Philosopher's Stone.
697,25,35,3,Harry!
698,25,35,5,"Hello there, Firenze. I see you've met our young Mr. Potter. You all right there, Harry?"
699,25,35,87,"Harry Potter, this is where I leave you. You're safe now. Good luck."
700,26,39,3,"You mean You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest?"
701,26,39,1,"But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong! Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself; he wants the Stone for Voldemort. With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again. He'll... he'll come back."
702,26,39,2,"But, if he comes back, you don't think he'll try to... kill you, do you?"
703,26,39,1,"I think if he'd had the chance, he might've tried to kill me tonight."
704,26,39,2,And to think I've been worrying about my Potions final.
705,26,39,3,"Hang on a minute.  We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared? Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore's around, Harry, you're safe. As long as Dumbledore's around, you can't be touched."
706,27,39,3,"I've always heard Hogwarts' end of the year exams were frightful, but I found that rather enjoyable."
707,27,39,2,"Speak for yourself. All right there, Harry?"
708,27,39,1,My scar. It keeps burning.
709,27,39,3,It's happened before.
710,27,39,1,Not like this.
711,27,39,2,Perhaps you should see the nurse.
712,27,39,1,I think it's a warning. It means dangers coming. Uhh!  Oh. Of course!
713,27,39,3,What is it?
714,27,39,1,"Don't you think it's a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon, and a stranger shows up and just happens to have one?  I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pockets? Why didn't I see it before? Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg?  What did he look like?"
715,27,39,5,I don't know. I never saw his face. He kept his hood up.
716,27,39,1,"The stranger, though, you and he must have talked."
717,27,39,5,"Well, he wanted to know what sort of creatures I looked after. I told him. I said, ""After Fluffy, a dragon's gonna be no problem."""
718,27,39,1,And did he seem interested in Fluffy?
719,27,39,5,"Well, of course he was interested in Fluffy! How often do you come across a three headed dog, even if you're in the trade? But I told him. I said, ""The trick with any beast is to know how to calm him. Take Fluffy, for example, just play him a bit of music and he falls straight to sleep."""
720,27,39,5,I shouldn't have told you that. Where you going?! Wait!
721,27,39,1,"We have to see Professor Dumbledore, immediately!"
722,27,39,7,I'm afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here. He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and left immediately for London.
723,27,39,1,He's gone?! Now? But this is important! It's about...the Philosopher's Stone.
724,27,39,7,How do you know ?
725,27,39,1,Someone's going to try and steal it.
726,27,39,7,"I don't know how you three found out about the stone, but I can assure you it is perfectly well-protected. Now would you go back to your dormitories? Quietly."
727,27,39,1,"That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village. It was Snape, which means he knows how to get past Fluffy."
728,27,39,3,And with Dumbledore gone
729,27,39,6,"Good afternoon. Now, what would three young Gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on a day like this?"
730,27,39,3,Uh...we were just...
731,27,39,6,You want to be careful. People will think you're  up to something.
732,27,39,3,Now what do we do?
733,27,39,1,We go down the trapdoor. Tonight.
734,27,39,1,Trevor.
735,27,39,2,"Trevor shh! Go, you shouldn't be here!"
736,27,39,10,"Neither should you. You're sneaking out again, arent you?"
737,27,39,1,"Now, Neville, listen. We were"
738,27,39,10,No! I won't let you!  You'll get Gryffindor in trouble again! I-I'll fight you.
739,27,39,3,"Neville, I'm really, really sorry about this... Petrificus Totalus."
740,27,39,2,"You're a little scary sometimes...you know that? Brilliant, but scary."
741,27,39,1,Let's go.  Sorry.
742,27,59,3,Sorry.
743,27,59,2,"It's for your own good, you know."
744,27,59,3,Ow! You stood on my foot!
745,27,59,2,Sorry.
746,27,59,3,Alohomora.
747,27,59,2,Wait a minute...he's.... Sleeping.
748,27,59,1,Snape's already been here. He's put a spell on the harp.
749,27,59,2,Uh. It's got horrible breath!
750,27,59,1,We have to move its paw.
751,27,59,2,What?!
752,27,59,1,"Come on!  Okay. Push!  I'll go first. Don't follow until I give you a sign.  If something bad happens, get yourselves out...Does it seem a bit...quiet?"
753,27,59,3,The harp. It stopped playing.
754,27,59,2,Ew! Yuck! Ugh.
755,27,59,1,Jump! Go!
756,27,64,2,"Ahh!  Whoa. Lucky this plant-thing is here, really."
757,27,64,1,Whoa!  Oh. Ahh!
758,27,64,3,"Stop moving, both of you. This is Devil's Snare. You have to relax. If you don't, it will only kill you faster."
759,27,64,2,"Kill us faster?! Oh, now I can relax!"
760,27,64,2,Hermione!!
761,27,64,1,Hermione!!
762,27,64,2,Now what are we gonna do?!
763,27,64,3,Just relax!
764,27,64,1,Hermione! Where are you?!
765,27,64,3,Do what I say. Trust me.
766,27,64,2,Ahh! Harry!
767,27,64,2,Harry!
768,27,64,3,Are you okay?
769,27,64,1,"Yeah, yeah, I'm fine."
770,27,64,2,Help!
771,27,64,3,"He's not relaxing, is he?"
772,27,64,1,Apparently not.
773,27,64,2,Help! Help me!
774,27,64,3,We've got to do something!
775,27,64,1,What?
776,27,64,3,Uh! I remember reading something in Herbology.
777,27,64,2,Help!
778,27,64,3,"Um Devil's Snare, Devil's Scare,  it's deadly fun...but will sulk in the sun! That's it! Devil's Snare hates sunlight!  Lumos Solem!"
779,27,64,2,Ahhh!
780,27,64,1,"Ron, are you okay?"
781,27,64,2,Yeah.
782,27,64,1,Okay.
783,27,64,2,Whew. Lucky we didn't panic!
784,27,64,1,Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology.
785,27,64,3,What is that?
786,27,64,1,I don't know. Sounds like wings.
787,27,64,3,Curious. I've never seen birds like these.
788,27,64,1,"They're not birds, they're keys. And I'll bet one of them fits that door."
789,27,64,3,What's this all about?
790,27,64,1,I don't know. Strange.
791,27,64,2,"Alohomora!  Well, it was worth a try."
792,27,64,3,Ugh! What're we going to do? There must be 1000 keys up there!
793,27,64,2,We're looking for a big old fashioned one. Probably rusty like the handle.
794,27,64,1,There! I see it!  The one with the broken wing!
795,27,64,3,"What's wrong, Harry?"
796,27,64,1,It's too simple.
797,27,64,2,"Oh, go on, Harry! If Snape can catch it on that old broomstick, you can! You're the youngest seeker in a century!"
798,27,64,2,This complicates things a bit!
799,27,64,1,Catch the key!
800,27,64,2,Hurry up!
801,28,64,3,I don't like this. I don't like this at all.
802,28,64,1,Where are we? A graveyard.
803,28,64,2,This is no graveyard.  It's a chessboard.
804,28,64,1,There's the door.
805,28,64,3,Now what do we do?
806,28,64,2,"It's obvious, isn't it? We've got to play our way across the room. All right. Harry, you take the Bishop's square. Hermione, you'll be the Queen's side castle. As for me, I'll be a knight."
807,28,64,3,What happens now?
808,28,64,2,"Well, white moves first, and then...we play."
809,28,64,3,"Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like...real wizard's chess, do you?"
810,28,64,2,"You there! D-5!  Yes, Hermione, I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess!"
811,29,64,2,"Castle to E-4! Smash! Ron: Pawn to C-3! Smash! Boom! The Queen turns, and smashes a piece! Harry, Ron and Hermione wince. The Queen turns again. Both Ron and Harry study the game."
812,29,64,1,Wait a minute.
813,29,64,2,"You understand right, Harry. Once I make my move, the Queen will take me...then you'll be free to check the King."
814,29,64,1,"No, Ron! No!"
815,29,64,3,What is it?
816,29,64,1,He's going to sacrifice himself!
817,29,64,3,"No, Ron, you can't!  There must be another way!"
818,29,64,2,"Do you want to stop Snape or not? Harry, it's you that has to go on. I know it. Not me, not Hermione, you.  Knight...to H-3."
819,29,64,2,Check.
820,29,64,2,Ahhhh!
821,29,64,1,"RON!  NO! Don't move! Dont forget, we're still playing.  Checkmate.  Take care of Ron. Then, go to the owlery. Send a message to Dumbledore. Ron's right...I have to go on."
822,29,64,3,"You'll be okay, Harry. You're a great wizard, you really are."
823,29,64,1,Not as good as you.
824,29,64,3,"Me? Books and cleverness? There are more important things. Friendship, and bravery. And Harry, just be careful."
825,30,64,1,"You?  No. I-it can't be. Snape, h-he was the one--"
826,30,64,41,"Yes. He does seem the type, doesn't he? Next to him, who would suspect p-p-p-poor st-stuttering Professor Quirrell?"
827,30,64,1,"But-but that day, during the Quidditch match, Snape tried to kill me."
828,30,64,41,"No, dear boy. I tried to kill you.  And trust me, if Snape's cloak hadn't caught fire and broken my eye contact, I would have succeeded, even with Snape muttering his little countercurse."
829,30,64,1,Snape was trying to save me?
830,30,64,41,I knew you were a danger to me right from the off. Especially after Halloween.
831,30,64,1,Then-then you let the troll in.
832,30,64,41,"Very good, Potter, yes. Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled. While everyone else was running about the dungeon, he went to the third floor to head me off. He, of course, never trusted me again.  He rarely left me alone. But he doesn't understand. I'm never alone, never.  Now, what does this mirror do? I see what I desire. I see myself holding the stone. But how do I get it?"
833,30,64,9,Use the boy.
834,30,64,41,"Come here, Potter. Now!  Tell me... what do you see?  What is it?  What do you see?"
835,30,64,1,I-I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore. I've won the House Cup.
836,30,64,9,He lies.
837,30,64,41,Tell the truth! What do you see?!
838,30,64,9,Let me speak to him.
839,30,64,41,"Master, you are not strong enough."
840,30,64,9,I have strength enough for this.
841,30,64,9,"Harry Potter, we meet again."
842,30,64,1,Voldemort.
843,30,64,9,"Yes. You see what I've become? See what I must do to survive? Live off another, a mere parasite. Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can, something that, conveniently enough, lies in your pocket."
844,31,64,9,Stop him.  Don't be a fool! Why suffer a horrific death when you can join me and live?!
845,31,64,1,Never!
846,31,64,9,"Haha. Bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry, would you like to see your mother and father again? Together, we can bring them back.  All I ask for is something in return.  That's it, Harry. There is no good and evil. There is only power, and those too weak to seek it. Together, we'll do extraordinary things. Just give me the stone!"
847,31,64,1,You liar!
848,31,64,9,Kill him!
849,31,64,41,Ahh! Ahh!  What is this magic?
850,31,64,9,Fool! Get the stone!
851,32,43,4,"Good afternoon, Harry. Ah. Tokens from your admirers?"
852,32,43,1,Admirers?
853,32,43,4,"What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows.  Ah, I see your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your Chocolate Frogs."
854,32,43,1,Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione?
855,32,43,4,Fine. They're both just fine.
856,32,43,1,"But, what happened to the Stone?"
857,32,43,4,"Relax, dear boy. The stone has been destroyed. My friend Nicholas and I had a little chat and agreed it was best all around."
858,32,43,1,"But Flamel, he'll die, won't he?"
859,32,43,4,"He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. But yes, he will die."
860,32,43,1,"How is it I got the Stone, sir? One minute I was staring in the mirror, and the next..."
861,32,43,4,"Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone, find it, but not use it, would be able to get it. That is one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me that's saying something."
862,32,43,1,"Does that mean, with the Stone gone, I mean, that Voldemort can never come back?"
863,32,43,4,"Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him?  It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark.  No, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin."
864,32,43,1,What is it?
865,32,43,4,"Love, Harry, love.  Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans. I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one, and since then I have lost my liking for them. But I think I could be safe with a nice toffee... Mm. Alas. Earwax."
866,32,43,1,"All right there, Ron?"
867,32,43,2,All right? You?
868,32,43,1,All right. Hermione?
869,32,43,3,Never better.
870,33,36,4,"Another year, gone! And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarded and the points stand thus. In fourth place: Gryffindor, with 312 points!  In third place: Hufflepuff, with 352 points!  Second: Ravenclaw, with 426 points!  And in first place, with 472 points: Slytherin house!  Yes, well done Slytherin, well done Slytherin. However, recent events must be taken into account and I have a few last minute points to award.  First, to Miss Hermione Granger, for the cool use of intellect while others were in grave peril: fifty points!  Second, to Mr Ronald Weasley, for the best played game of chess that Hogwarts has seen these many years: fifty points!  And third, to mister Harry Potter, for pure love and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house: sixty points!"
871,33,36,3,We're tied with Slytherin!
872,33,36,4,"And finally: it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends. I award ten points to Neville Longbottom!  Assuming that my calculations are correct, I believe that a change of decoration is in order!  Gryffindor wins the House Cup!"
873,33,36,5,Yes!
874,33,36,29,Neville!
875,33,36,52,Yeah! We won!!
876,34,36,5,"Come on now, hurry up. You'll be late. Train's leaving. Go on. Go on. Come on. Hurry up."
877,34,36,3,"Come on, Harry."
878,34,36,1,One minute.
879,34,36,5,"Thought you were leaving without saying good-bye, didja?  This is for you."
880,34,36,1,"Thanks, Hagrid."
881,34,36,5,"Oh. Go on...on with you.  Oh, listen, Harry, if that dolt of a cousin of yours, Dudley, gives you any grief, you could always, um, threaten him with a nice pair of ears to go with that tail of his."
882,34,36,1,"But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that."
883,34,36,5,"I do. But your cousin don't, do he? Eh?  Off you go."
884,34,36,3,"Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?"
885,34,36,1,I'm not going home. Not really.
886,35,8,1,"I can't let you out, Hedwig. I'm not allowed to use magic outside of school. Besides, if Uncle Vernon"
887,35,8,21,Harry Potter!
888,35,8,1,Now you've done it.
889,35,8,32,He's in there. Vernon
890,35,8,21,"I'm warning you, if you can't control that bloody bird it'll have to go."
891,35,8,1,But she's bored! If I could only let outonly let out for an hour or two.
892,35,8,21,"Huh, huh! So you could send secret messages to you freaky little friends. No, sir!"
893,35,8,1,But I haven't had any messages from any of my friends not one all summer.
894,35,8,31,Who'd want to be friends with you?
895,35,8,21,"I should think you'd be a little more grateful. We've raised you since you were a baby, given you the food off our table, even let you have Dudley's second bedroom, purely out of the goodness of our hearts."
896,35,8,32,"Not now, Bopkins. For when the Masons arrive."
897,35,8,21,"Which should be any minute! AhemNow let's go over our schedule once again, shall we? Petunia when the Masons arrive you will be?"
898,35,8,32,"in the lounge, waiting to welcome them graciously into our home."
899,35,8,21,"Good! And- and Dudley, you will be?"
900,35,8,31,I'll be waiting to open the door!
901,35,8,21,Excellent! And you?
902,35,8,1,"I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending that I don't exist."
903,35,8,21,"Too right, you will. With any luck, this could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career. And you will not mess it up!"
904,36,8,21,Mr. and Mrs. Mason! Do come in!
905,36,8,27,"Ha- ha- ha! Ha, ha! Ho, ho, ho! Ha, ha! Harry Potter! Such an honor it is!"
906,36,8,1,Who are you?
907,36,8,27,"Dobby sir, Dobby the house elf."
908,36,8,1,"Not to be to be rude or anything, but this isn't a great time for me to have a house elf in my bedroom."
909,36,8,27,"Oh, oh yes, sir! Dobby understands! It's just that, Dobby has come to tell you- it is difficult, sir- Dobby wonders where to begin?"
910,36,8,1,Why don't you sit down?
911,36,8,27,"S-sit down? S-sit- sit down? Oh, oh, ho. Oh, ho, ho Oh, ho, ho. Ohh, ho, hoo"
912,36,8,1,"Dobby, ssh! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to offend you, or anything."
913,36,8,27,"Offend Dobby? Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but never has he been asked to sit down by a wizard, like an equal."
914,36,8,1,You can't have met many decent wizards then.
915,36,8,27,"No, I haven't. That was an awful thing to say. Bad Dobby!"
916,36,8,1,"Stop, Dobby!"
917,36,8,27,Bad Dobby!
918,36,8,1,"Dobby, shh!"
919,36,8,27,Baaad Dobby!
920,36,8,1,"Dobby, please stop!"
921,36,8,21,"Ohh, don't mind that! It's just the cat."
922,36,8,27,Bad Dobby. Bad Dobby!
923,36,8,1,"Stop! Stop, Dobby. Please be quiet! Are you all right?"
924,36,8,27,"Dobby had to punish himself, sir. Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir."
925,36,8,1,Your family?
926,36,8,27,"The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. Dobby is bound to serve one family forever. If they ever knew Dobby was hereooh But Dobby had to come. Dobby has to protect Harry Potter- to warn him. Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year! There is a plot, a plot to make most terrible things happen."
927,36,8,1,What terrible things? Who's plotting them?
928,36,8,27,Ooo er can't say argh...
929,36,8,1,Okâ I- understand. You can't- say.
930,36,8,27,"Don't make me talk, I- Errr"
931,36,8,1,"Dobby! Dobby, put the lamp down."
932,36,8,27,Bad Dobby.
933,36,8,21,So when they arrive at the ninth hole
934,36,8,1,Give me the lamp! Dobby stop!
935,36,8,27,Let me go!
936,36,8,1,"Get in there, and keep quiet!"
937,36,8,21,What the devil are you doing up here?
938,36,8,1,I- I was just-
939,36,8,21,You just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke!
940,36,8,1,Sorry.
941,36,8,21,"One more sound, and you'll wish you'd never been born, boy! And fix that door!"
942,36,8,1,"Yes, sir See why I've got to go back? I don't belong here. I belong in your world, at Hogwarts. It's the only place I've got friends!"
943,36,8,27,Friends who don't even write to Harry Potter?
944,36,8,1,"Well, I expect they've been- hang on- how do you know my friends haven't been writing to me?"
945,36,8,27,"Harry Potter mustn't be angry with Dobby. Heh- Dobby hoped, if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him, Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir."
946,36,8,1,"Give me those, now!"
947,36,8,27,No! Ahh! Ooh
948,36,8,1,"Dobby, get back here!"
949,36,8,1,"Dobby, please, no!"
950,36,8,27,Harry Potter must say he's not going back to school!
951,36,8,1,I can't. Hogwarts is my home!
952,36,8,27,"Then, Dobby must do it, sir, for Harry Potter's own good."
953,36,8,21,"it spread as far as the eye could see, all over the floor of this vast building, and it was this deep. And one plumber said Look at all that water.â A-and the second plumber said, Yes, and that's just the top of it!â"
954,36,8,21,I'm so sorry! It's my nephew- he's very disturbed. Meeting strangers upsets him. That's why I kept him upstairs!
955,37,8,21,You're never going back to that school. You're never going to see those freaky friends of yours again. Never!
956,37,8,1,Ron! Fred. George. What are you all doing here?
957,37,8,2,"Rescuing you, of course. Now, come on. Get your trunk!"
958,37,8,2,You'd better stand back. Let's go!
959,37,8,32,Oh!
960,37,8,21,"Now, what the hell's he doing? Potter!"
961,37,8,31,Dad! What's going on?
962,37,8,19,"Go, go, go, go!"
963,37,8,31,"Dad, hurry up!"
964,37,8,2,Come on.
965,37,8,14,Come on.
966,37,8,2,"Come on, Harry! Hurry up!"
967,37,8,21,"Petunia, he's escaping!"
968,37,8,1,Ahh- ahh!
969,37,8,2,I've got you Harry!
970,37,8,21,Come here!
971,37,8,1,Let go of me!
972,37,8,21,"Oh no, boy! You and that bloody pigeon aren't going anywhere!"
973,37,8,1,Get off!
974,37,8,2,Drive!
975,37,8,14,Right.
976,37,8,19,Right!
977,37,8,21,No! No! No! No! Aaaah!
978,37,8,32,Aaah!
979,37,8,31,Aaah!
980,37,8,31,Dad!
981,37,8,21,Oh Damn.
982,38,17,14,"Come on. Okay, come on. Shh! Shh! Ok, come on. Shh! Come on."
983,38,17,2,Do you think it'd be all right if we had some of this?
984,38,17,19,"Yeah, Mum would never know."
985,38,17,2,"It's not much, but it's home."
986,38,17,1,I think it's brilliant
987,38,17,26,"Where have you been? Harry, how wonderful to see you dear. Beds empty! No note! Car gone! You could have died! You could have been seen! Of course, I don't blame you, Harry dear."
988,38,17,2,"They were starving him, Mum. There were bars on his window!"
989,38,17,26,"Well, you'd best hope that I don't put bars on your window, Ronald Weasley! Come on Harry, time for a spot of breakfast. Here we are Harry. Now tuck in! That's it. There we go."
990,38,17,20,"Mum- Mummy, have you seen my jumper?"
991,38,17,26,Yes dear. It was on the cat.
992,38,17,1,Hello. W-what did I do?
993,38,17,2,Ginny. She's been talking about you all summer. A bit annoying really.
994,38,17,16,"Morning, Weasleys."
995,38,17,14,"Morning, Dad."
996,38,17,19,"Morning, Dad."
997,38,17,2,"Morning, Dad."
998,38,17,26,Morning Arthur!
999,38,17,16,What a night. Nine raids. Nine!
1000,38,17,1,Raids?
1001,38,17,2,"Dad works in the Ministry of Magic, in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office. Dad loves Muggles, thinks they're fascinating."
1002,38,17,16,Well now. Aah! And who are you?
1003,38,17,1,"Oh, sorry sir. I'm Harry, sir, Harry Potter."
1004,38,17,16,"Good Lord! Are you really? Well, Ron's told us all about you, of course. When did he get here?"
1005,38,17,26,This morning. Your sons flew that enchanted car of yours to Surrey and back last night.
1006,38,17,16,Did you really? How'd it go? Did you-
1007,38,17,14,"Oh, it"
1008,38,17,19,"Oh, it"
1009,38,17,2,"Oh, it"
1010,38,17,1,"Oh, it"
1011,38,17,26,Arthur!
1012,38,17,16,"I meanthat was very wrong, indeed, boys. Very wrong of you. Now, Harry, you must know all about Muggles. Tell me, what exactly is the function of a rubber duck?"
1013,38,17,1,"Oh, umm"
1014,38,17,26,"Well, that'll be Errol with the post. Oh, fetch it will you Percy, please?"
1015,38,17,37,Errol
1016,38,17,2,He's always doing that.
1017,38,17,37,"Oh look, it's our Hogwarts letters. And they've sent us Harry's as well."
1018,38,17,16,"Dumbledore must know you're here, Harry. Doesn't miss a trick, that man."
1019,38,17,26,"Oh, no."
1020,38,17,14,"This lot won't come cheap, Mum. The spell books alone are very expensive."
1021,38,17,26,We'll manage. There's only one place we're going to get all of this. Diagon Alley.
1022,39,17,26,"Right. Here we are Harry, you go first dear."
1023,39,17,2,"But Harry's never traveled by Floo powder before, Mum."
1024,39,17,1,Floo powder?
1025,39,17,26,"Oh, well you go first Ron, so that Harry can see how it's done. Yes. In you go That's it."
1026,39,17,2,Diagon Alley!
1027,39,17,26,"You see? It's quite easy, dear. Don't be afraid. Come on. Come on. In you go. That's it, mind your head. That's right. Now take your Floo powder. That's it, very good. Now, don't forget to speak very, very clearly."
1028,39,17,1,'Diaganilly.'
1029,39,17,26,"What did he say, dear?"
1030,39,17,16,'Diaganilly.'
1031,39,17,26,I thought he did.
1032,39,3,126,"Ah, ha-ha-ha-ha"
1033,39,3,132,"Not lost are you, my dear?"
1034,39,3,1,"I'm fine, thank you. I- I was just"
1035,39,3,126,Come with us. We'll help you find your way back.
1036,39,3,1,No! Please!
1037,39,3,5,Harry?
1038,39,3,1,Hagrid!
1039,39,3,5,What do you think you're doing down 'ere? Come on!
1040,39,1,5,"Yer a mess, Harry. Skulkin' 'round Knockturn Alley? Dodgy place! Don' want no one ter see you there. People'll think you were up to no good."
1041,39,1,1,"I was lost, I- hang on. What were you doing down there, then?"
1042,39,1,5,"Me? Oh, I was um I was lookin' for Flesh-Eatin' Slug Repellent. They're ruinin' all the school cabbages."
1043,39,1,3,Harry! Hagrid!
1044,39,1,5,"Hello, Hermione!"
1045,39,1,3,"Oh, it's so good to see you!"
1046,39,1,1,"Well, it's great to see you, too!"
1047,39,1,3,What did you do to your glasses? Oculus reparo.
1048,39,1,1,I definitely need to remember that one.
1049,39,1,5,"You'll be all right now then, Harry? Right. I'll leave you to it, then."
1050,39,1,3,Ok! Bye!
1051,39,1,1,Thank you. Bye.
1052,39,1,3,Come on! Everyone's been so worried.
1053,40,1,126,Harry Harry Potter
1054,40,1,26,"Oh, Harry! Thank goodness! We'd hoped you'd only gone one grate too far"
1055,40,1,126,"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Gilderoy Lockhart."
1056,40,1,26,Ah! Here he is!
1057,40,1,2,Mum fancies him.
1058,40,1,152,"Make way there. Please! Let me by, madam. Thank you. Excuse me, little girl. This is for the Daily Prophet."
1059,40,1,28,It can't be- Harry Potter?
1060,40,1,152,"Harry Potter! Excuse me, madam."
1061,40,1,28,"Nice big smile, Harry. Together you and I rate the front page! Ladies and gentlemen, what an extraordinary moment this is. When young Harry stepped into Flourish and Blotts this morning to purchase my autobiography, Magical Me, which, incidentally is currently celebrating its 27th week atop the Daily Prophet bestseller list, he had no idea that he would, in fact, be leaving with my entire collected works, free of charge. Now, ladies?"
1062,40,1,26,"Harry, now you give me those, and I'll get them signed. All of you wait outside. That's it, Ron."
1063,40,1,12,"I'll bet you loved that, didn't you, Potter? Famous Harry Potter! Can't even go into a bookshop without making the front page."
1064,40,1,20,Leave him alone.
1065,40,1,12,"Oh look, Potter. You've got yourself a girlfriend."
1066,40,1,23,"Now, now Draco, play nicely. Mr. Potter Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last. Forgive me, your scar is legend, as, of course, is the wizard who gave it to you."
1067,40,1,1,Voldemort killed my parents. He was nothing more than a murderer.
1068,40,1,23,"Hmm. You must be very brave, to mention his nameor very foolish."
1069,40,1,3,Fear of a name only increase fear of the thing itself.
1070,40,1,23,"And you must be Miss Granger. Yes, Draco's told me all about you, and your parents. Muggles, aren't they? Let me seered hair vacant expressions tatty second hand book. You must be the Weasleys."
1071,40,1,16,"Children, it's mad in here! Let's go outside."
1072,40,1,23,"Well, well, well. Weasley senior."
1073,40,1,16,Lucius.
1074,40,1,23,"Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur, all those extra raids? I do hope they're paying you overtime, but judging by the state of this, I'd say not. What's the use in being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don't even pay you well for it."
1075,40,1,16,"We have a very different idea about what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy."
1076,40,1,23,Clearly. Associating with Muggles and I thought your family could sink no lower. I'll see you at work.
1077,40,1,12,See you at school.
1078,41,71,16,10:58! Come on! Come on!
1079,41,71,26,The train will be leaving any moment!
1080,41,71,16,"Fred, George, Percy you first!"
1081,41,71,26,Okay.
1082,41,71,16,"After you, dear."
1083,41,71,26,"Come on, Ginny, we'll get you a seat. Hurry!"
1084,41,71,1,Let's go.
1085,41,71,1,Aah!
1086,41,71,2,Whao!
1087,41,71,162,Oy! What do you two think you're doing?
1088,41,71,1,Sorry. Lost- lost control of the trolley. Why can't we get through?
1089,41,71,2,I don't know. The gateway's sealed its self for some reason.
1090,41,71,1,The train leaves at exactly eleven o'clock. We've missed it!
1091,41,71,2,"Harry, if we can't get through, maybe Mum and Dad can't get back!"
1092,41,71,1,Maybe we should just go and wait by the car.
1093,41,71,2,The car
1094,41,42,1,"Ron, I should tell you, most Muggles aren't accustomed to seeing a flying car."
1095,41,42,2,"Uh, right. Okay."
1096,41,42,2,Oh no! The Invisibility Booster must be faulty!
1097,41,42,1,"Well come on, then. Let's go lower. We need to find the train."
1098,41,42,2,Okay.
1099,41,42,1,Now all we need to do is catch up with the train.
1100,41,42,2,We can't be far behind.
1101,41,42,1,Do you hear that?
1102,41,42,2,We must be gettin' close.
1103,41,42,1,Hold on
1104,41,42,1,Aaahhh! Aaahhhh! Aaahhh!
1105,41,42,2,Aaahhh! Aaahhhh! Aaahhh!
1106,41,42,1,Wha-aahhh!
1107,41,42,2,Harry! Hold on! Take my hand! Hold on!
1108,41,42,1,I'm trying. Your hand's all sweaty.
1109,41,42,1,I think we found the train.
1110,41,42,2,Yeah.
1111,42,67,2,Welcome home.
1112,42,67,1,Up! Up!
1113,42,67,2,It's not working! Ahhhh!
1114,42,67,1,Up! Up! Ron! Mind that tree!
1115,42,67,2,Stop! Stop! Stop! Huh Aahh!
1116,42,67,1,Ahh!
1117,42,67,2,Ahh-ha-ha! My wand! Look at my wand!
1118,42,67,1,Be thankful it's not your neck.
1119,42,67,2,What's happening?
1120,42,67,1,I don't know.
1121,42,67,155,Argg!
1122,42,67,1,Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!
1123,42,67,2,Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!
1124,42,67,2,Ahh! Ahhhh! Ahh!
1125,42,67,1,Aaaahhhh!
1126,42,67,2,Aaaahhhh!
1127,42,67,1,Come on! Go! Fast!
1128,42,67,1,Ahh!
1129,42,67,2,Ahh!
1130,42,67,2,"Scabbers, you OK? The car! Dad's gonna kill me."
1131,43,49,1,"See you, Hedwig. So, a house elf shows up in my bedroom, we can't get through the barrier to platform nine and three-quarters, we almost get killed by a tree clearly someone doesn't want me here this year."
1132,43,49,35,"Well, take a good look lads. This night might well be the last you spend in this castle. Hm. Oh, dear, we are in trouble."
1133,43,49,6,You were seen by no less than seven Muggles. Do you have any idea how serious this is? You have risked the exposure of our world. Not to mention the damage you inflicted on a Whomping Willow that's been on these grounds since before you were born.
1134,43,49,2,"Honestly, Professor Snape, I think it did more damage to us."
1135,43,49,6,"Silence! I assure you, that were you in Slytherin, and your fate rested with me, the both of you would be on the train home- tonight. As it is"
1136,43,49,4,They are not.
1137,43,49,1,Professor Dumbledore. Professor McGonagall.
1138,43,49,6,"Headmaster, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry. As such--"
1139,43,49,4,"I am well aware of our bylaws, Severus, having written quite a few of them myself. However, as head of Gryffindor house, it is for Professor McGonagall to determine the appropriate action."
1140,43,49,2,"We'll go and get our stuff, then."
1141,43,49,7,"What are you talking about, Mr. Weasley?"
1142,43,49,2,"You're going to expel us, aren't you?"
1143,43,49,7,"Not today, Mr. Weasley. But, I must impress on both of you the seriousness of what you have done. I will be writing to your families tonight, and you will both receive detention."
1144,44,38,79,"Morning, everyone! Good morning, everyone!"
1145,44,38,136,"Good morning, Professor Sprout!"
1146,44,38,79,"Welcome to Greenhouse Three, Second Years. Now, gather around, everyone. Today, we are going to repot Mandrakes. Who here can tell me the properties of the Mandrake root? Yes, Miss Granger."
1147,44,38,3,"Mandrake, or Mandragora, is used to return those who have been Petrified to their original state. It's also quite dangerous. The Mandrake's cry is fatal to anyone who hears it."
1148,44,38,79,"Excellent! Ten points to Gryffindor! Now, as our Mandrakes are still only seedlings their cries won't kill you yet. But they could knock you out for several hours, which is why I have given each of you a pair of earmuffs for auditory protection. So, could you please put them on, right away? Quickly! Flaps tight down, and watch me closely. You grasp your Mandrake firmly, you pull it sharply up out of the pot"
1149,44,38,136,Aah! Ooh!
1150,44,38,79,Got it? And now you dunk it down into the other pot and pour a little sprinkling of soil to keep him warm.
1151,44,38,10,Uhh
1152,44,38,79,"Uh, Longbottom's been neglecting his earmuffs."
1153,44,38,29,"No, ma'am, he's just fainted."
1154,44,38,79,"Yes, well, just leave him there. Right! On we go! Plenty of pots to go around. Grasp your Mandrake, and pull it up!"
1155,44,36,126,There's Nearly-Headless-Nick!
1156,44,36,47,"Hello, Percy. Miss Clearwater."
1157,44,36,37,"Hello, Sir Nicholas!"
1158,44,36,2,"Huhh Say it, I'm doomed."
1159,44,36,1,You're doomed.
1160,44,36,106,"Hi, Harry!  I'm Colin Creevy! I'm in Gryffindor, too!"
1161,44,36,1,"Oh- Hi, Colin. Nice to meet you."
1162,44,36,75,Ron? Is that your owl?
1163,44,36,127,"Ha-ha Ha, ha."
1164,44,36,2,"Bloody bird's a menace. Oh, no!"
1165,44,36,29,"Look, everyone! Weasley's got himself a Howler!"
1166,44,36,10,"Go on, Ron. I ignored one from my gran once. It was horrible."
1167,44,36,159,"RONALD WEASLEY! HOW DARE YOU STEAL THAT CAR! I AM ABSOLUTLEY DISGUSTED! YOUR FATHER'S NOW FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK, AND IT'S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT! IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE, WE'LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT HOME! Oh, and Ginny, dear, congratulations on making Gryffindor. Your father and I are so proud. Thhhhbt!"
1168,45,30,28,"Let me introduce you to your new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher me! Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League, and five-times winner of Witch Weekly's Most-Charming-Smile Award- but I don't talk about that. I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at him. Huh, huh, huh hee, hee Now- be warned! It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind. You may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room. Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here. I must ask you not to scream. It might provoke them!"
1169,45,30,29,Cornish pixies?
1170,45,30,28,Freshly caught Cornish pixies!
1171,45,30,29,"Ha, ha. Ha, ha, ha"
1172,45,30,28,"Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnigan, but pixies can be devilish tricky little blighters. Let's see what you make of them, ha! Come on now- round them up, round them up, they're only pixies!"
1173,45,30,142,Just stay there!
1174,45,30,10,Ah! Aaah! Aaah! Aah- aah!
1175,45,30,10,"Hey, get me down!"
1176,45,30,3,Get off me!
1177,45,30,1,Stop! Stop! Hold still!
1178,45,30,28,Peskipiksi pesternomi!
1179,45,30,142,"Hee, hee, hee!"
1180,45,30,142,Yeeee-haw!
1181,45,30,142,Wheee!
1182,45,30,28,I'll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage!
1183,45,30,2,What do we do now?
1184,45,30,3,Immobulus!
1185,45,30,10,Why is it always me?
1186,46,45,46,"I spent the summer devising a whole new Quidditch program. We are gonna train earlier, harder, and longer. What- I don't believe it! Where do you think you're goin', Flint?"
1187,46,45,82,Quidditch practice.
1188,46,45,46,I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.
1189,46,45,82,"Easy, Wood. I've got a note."
1190,46,45,2,Uh-oh. I smell trouble.
1191,46,45,46,"I, Professor Severus Snape, do hereby give the Slytherin team permission to practice today, owing to the need to train their new Seeker.â You've got a new Seeker. Who?"
1192,46,45,1,Malfoy?
1193,46,45,12,That's right. And that's not all that new this year.
1194,46,45,2,Those are Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones! How did you get those?
1195,46,45,82,A gift from Draco's father.
1196,46,45,12,"You see Weasley, unlike some, my father can afford the best."
1197,46,45,3,At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in. They got it on pure talent.
1198,46,45,12,"No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood!"
1199,46,45,2,"You'll pay for that one, Malfoy. Eat slugs!"
1200,46,45,127,"Ha, ha, ha!"
1201,46,45,12,"Ha, ha!"
1202,46,45,3,"You okay, Ron? Say something!"
1203,46,45,126,Ooh! Ugh! Yech!
1204,46,45,106,"Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry?"
1205,46,45,1,"No, Colin! Get out of the way! Let's take him to Hagrid's."
1206,46,45,1,He'll know what to do.
1207,46,45,127,"Ha, ha, ha"
1208,46,45,12,"Ha, ha"
1209,46,40,5,"Wo, this calls for a specialist's equipment. Nothin' to do but wait'll it stops, I'm afraid."
1210,46,40,1,Ah! Oh Okay.
1211,46,40,5,"Better out than in. Who's Ron tryin' to curse, anyway?"
1212,46,40,1,"Malfoy. He called Hermione, um, well, I don't- I don't know exactly what it means."
1213,46,40,3,He called me a Mudblood.
1214,46,40,5,He did not!
1215,46,40,1,What's a Mudblood?
1216,46,40,3,It means dirty blood.â Mudblood's a really foul name for someone who is Muggle-born. Someone with non-magic parents. Someone like me. It's not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation.
1217,46,40,5,"See, the thing is, Harry, there're some wizards, like the Malfoy family, who think they're better'n everyone else because they're what people call pure blood.â"
1218,46,40,1,That's horrible!
1219,46,40,2,It's disgusting.
1220,46,40,5,"And it's codswallop, to boot. Dirty blood.â Why, there isn't a wizard alive today that's not half blood or less. More ter the point, they've yet to think of a spell that our Hermione can' do. Come here Don't you think on it, Hermione. Don't you think on it for one minute eh?"
1221,46,30,28,"Harry, Harry, Harry Can you possibly imagine a better way to serve detention than by helping me to answer my fan mail?"
1222,46,30,1,Not really.
1223,46,30,28,"Fame is a fickle friend, Harry. Celebrity is as celebrity does. Remember that."
1224,46,30,86,"Come, come, come to me. Come to me!"
1225,46,30,1,What?
1226,46,30,28,Sorry?
1227,46,30,1,That voice.
1228,46,30,28,Voice?
1229,46,30,1,Didn't you hear it?
1230,46,30,28,"What are you talking about, Harry? I think we're getting a bit a- drowsy. And, Great Scott- no wonder! Look at the time! We've been here nearly four hours! Spooky how the time flies when one's having fun. Heh, heh."
1231,46,30,1,Spooky.
1232,47,28,86,Blood. I smell blood. Let me rip you. Let me kill you. Kill! Kill!
1233,47,28,3,Harry!
1234,47,28,1,Did you hear it?
1235,47,28,2,Hear what?
1236,47,28,1,That voice.
1237,47,28,3,Voice? What voice?
1238,47,28,1,I heard it first in Lockhart's office. And then again just-
1239,47,28,86,It's time.
1240,47,28,1,It's moving. I think it's going to kill.
1241,47,28,2,Kill?
1242,47,28,3,"Harry, wait! Not so fast!"
1243,47,28,1,Strange. I've never seen spiders act like that.
1244,47,28,2,I don't like spiders What's that?
1245,47,28,3,The Chamber of Secrets has been opened enemies the heir beware.' It's written in blood.
1246,47,28,1,"Oh, no It's Filch's cat. It's Mrs. Norris."
1247,47,28,127,Ahhh! What's that?
1248,47,28,85,Oh!
1249,47,28,12,"'Enemies of the heir beware!' You'll be next, Mudbloods!"
1250,47,28,35,"What's going on 'ere? Go on, make way, make way. Potter-- What are youMrs. Norris? You'vemurdered my cat."
1251,47,28,1,No. No.
1252,47,28,35,I'll kill ya I'll kill ya!
1253,47,28,4,"Argus! Argus, I Everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately. Everyone except you three."
1254,47,28,126,"Ravenclaws, follow me!"
1255,47,28,4,"She's not dead, Argus. She has been Petrified."
1256,47,28,28,"Ah, thought so. So unlucky I wasn't there. I know exactly the counter curse that could have spared her."
1257,47,28,4,"But how she has been Petrified, I cannot say"
1258,47,28,35,Ask him. It's him who's done it. You saw what he wrote on the wall.
1259,47,28,1,"It's not true sir, I swear. I never touched Mrs. Norris."
1260,47,28,35,Rubbish!
1261,47,28,6,"If I might, Headmaster? Perhaps Potter and his friends were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. However, the circumstances are suspicious. I, for one, don't recall seeing Potter at dinner."
1262,47,28,28,"I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus. You see, Harry was helping me answer my fan mail."
1263,47,28,3,"That's why Ron and I went looking for him, Professor. We'd just found him when he said"
1264,47,28,6,"Yes, Miss Granger?"
1265,47,28,1,When I said I wasn't hungry. We were heading back to the common room when we found Mrs. Norris.
1266,47,28,4,"Innocent until proven guilty, Severus."
1267,47,28,35,My cat has been Petrified. I wanna see some punishment!
1268,47,28,4,"We will be able to cure her, Argus. As I understand it, Madame Sprout has a very healthy growth of Mandrakes. When matured, a potion will be made which will revive Mrs. Norris. And in the meantime, I strongly recommend caution to all."
1269,47,28,3,"It's a bit strange, isn't it?"
1270,47,28,1,Strange?
1271,47,28,3,"You hear this voice, a voice only you can hear, and then Mrs. Norris turns up Petrified. It's just strange."
1272,47,28,1,"Do you think I should have told them? Dumbledore and the others, I mean?"
1273,47,28,2,Are you mad?
1274,47,28,3,"No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world, hearing voices isn't a good sign."
1275,47,28,150,"She's right, you know."
1276,48,61,7,"Could I have your attention, please? Right. Now, today, we will be transforming animals into water goblets. Like so. One, two, three, Vera verto. Now it's your turn. Well, who would like to go first? Ah! Mr. Weasley. One, two, three. Vera verto.â"
1277,48,61,2,Ahem. Vera verto!
1278,48,61,127,"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha"
1279,48,61,7,"That wand needs replacing, Mr. Weasley. Yes, Miss Granger?"
1280,48,61,3,"Professor, I was wondering if you could tell us aboutthe Chamber of Secrets?"
1281,48,61,7,"Well, very well. Well, you all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. Now, three of the founders coexisted quite harmoniously. One did not."
1282,48,61,2,Three guesses who.
1283,48,61,7,"Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. In other words, pure-bloods.â Unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school. Now, according to legend, Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle, known as the Chamber of Secrets. Though, shortly before departing, he sealed it until that time when his own true heir returned to the school. The heir alone would be able to open the Chamber and unleash the horror within, and by so doing purge the school of all those who, in Slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic."
1284,48,61,3,Muggle-borns.
1285,48,61,7,"Well, naturally, the school had been searched many times. No such chamber has been found."
1286,48,61,3,Professor? What exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber?
1287,48,61,7,"Well, the Chamber is said to home to something that only the Heir of Slytherin can control. It is said to be the home of a monster."
1288,48,45,2,D'you think it's true? D'you think there really is a Chamber of Secrets?
1289,48,45,3,Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's worried. All the teachers are.
1290,48,45,1,"Well, if there really is a Chamber of Secrets, a-and it really has been opened, then that means---"
1291,48,45,3,"The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?"
1292,48,45,2,Let's think. Who do we know who thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?
1293,48,45,3,If you're talking about Malfoy.
1294,48,45,2,"Of course. You heard him! 'You'll be next Mudbloods,'"
1295,48,45,3,"I heard him. But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?"
1296,48,45,1,"Well, maybe Ron's right, Hermione. I mean, look at his family. The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries."
1297,48,45,2,Crabbe and Goyle must know. Maybe we could trick them into telling.
1298,48,45,3,"Even they aren't that thick. But there might be another way. Mind you, it would be difficult. Not to mention, we would be breaking about fifty school rules. And, it'll be dangerous. Very dangerous."
1299,49,44,3,"Here it is. 'The Polyjuice Potion.'  'Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another.'"
1300,49,44,2,"Do you mean, if Harry and I drink that stuff, we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?"
1301,49,44,3,Yes.
1302,49,44,2,Wicked! Malfoy'll tell us anything.
1303,49,44,3,Exactly. But it's tricky. I've never seen a more complicated potion.
1304,49,44,1,"Well, how long will it take to make?"
1305,49,44,3,A month.
1306,49,44,1,"A month? But, Hermione, if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin, he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then."
1307,49,44,3,I know. But it's the only plan we've got.
1308,49,52,127,Yeah! Come on Slytherin!
1309,49,52,52,Another goal for Slytherin! They lead Gryffindor ninety to thirty!
1310,49,52,82,Yeah! Yeah!
1311,49,52,12,"All right there, Scarhead?"
1312,49,52,46,"Watch yourself, Harry!"
1313,49,52,1,Wood! Look out!
1314,49,52,5,"Blimey! Harry's got himself a rogue Bludger! That's been tampered with, that has!"
1315,49,52,2,I'll stop it.
1316,49,52,3,No! Even with a proper wand it's too risky. You could hit Harry!
1317,49,52,12,"Training for the ballet, Potter?"
1318,49,52,12,"You'll never catch me, Potter!"
1319,49,52,3,Let's go.
1320,49,52,52,Harry Potter has caught the Snitch! Gryffindor wins!
1321,49,52,3,Finite incantatem!
1322,50,52,1,Thank you.
1323,50,52,3,Are you okay?
1324,50,52,1,"No, I think my- I think my arm's broken."
1325,50,52,28,"Not to worry, Harry. I will fix that arm of yours straight away."
1326,50,52,1,"No, not you."
1327,50,52,28,"Oh, poor boy doesn't know what he's saying. Now, this won't hurt a bit. Brackium emendo!"
1328,50,52,127,Oh! Ooh! Ugh!
1329,50,52,28,"Ah, yes, well, ha, that can sometimes happen, um, butuh, the point is, uh,"
1330,50,52,126,Ohh! Uhh!
1331,50,52,28,"you can no longer feel any pain, and, heh- very clearly, the bones are not broken."
1332,50,52,5,Broken? There's no bones left!
1333,50,52,127,Uh-huh-ugh!
1334,50,52,28,"Much more flexible, though."
1335,50,52,12,"Uhh, uhhh"
1336,50,43,85,"Oh, Mr. Malfoy, stop making such a fuss, you can go. Out of my way. Out of my way! Should've been brought straight to me. I can mend bones in a heartbeat- but growing them back"
1337,50,43,3,"You will be able to, won't you?"
1338,50,43,85,"Oh, I'll be able to, certainly. But it'll be painful. You're in for a rough night, Potter. Regrowing bones is a nasty business."
1339,50,43,1,Ugh!
1340,50,43,85,"Well, what do you expect? Pumpkin juice?"
1341,50,43,1,Uh!
1342,50,43,86,Kill. Kill Time to kill!
1343,50,43,27,Hello!
1344,50,43,1,Dobby?
1345,50,43,27,Harry Potter should have listened to Dobby! Harry Potter should have gone back home when he missed the train.
1346,50,43,1,It was you You stopped the barrier from letting Ron and me through.
1347,50,43,27,"Indeed. Yes, sir."
1348,50,43,1,You nearly got Ron and me expelled!
1349,50,43,27,At least you would be away from here. Harry Potter must go home! Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make Harry Potter see that---
1350,50,43,1,Your Bludger? You made that Bludger chase after me?
1351,50,43,27,"Uhuh Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir. Dobby had to iron his hands."
1352,50,43,1,"You'd better clear off before my bones come back, Dobby, or I might strangle you!"
1353,50,43,27,Uh-huh-huh Dobby is used to death threats sir. Dobby gets them five times a day at home.
1354,50,43,1,I don't suppose you could tell me why you're trying to kill me?
1355,50,43,27,"Not kill you, sir, never kill you! Dobby remembers how it was before Harry Potter triumphed over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. We house elves were treated like vermin, sir. Of course, Dobby is still treated like verminuh, huh, huh, huh! Aah, ahh"
1356,50,43,1,Why do you wear that thing Dobby?
1357,50,43,27,"This, sir? It is a mark of the house-elves' enslavement. Dobby can only be freed if his master presents him with clothes. Ah! Listen. Listen! Terrible things are about to happen at Hogwarts. Harry Potter must not stay here, now that history is to repeat itself."
1358,50,43,1,Repeat itself? You mean this has happened before?
1359,50,43,27,Ah! I shouldn't have said that! Oh! Ah! Dah! Bad Dobby! Bad!
1360,50,43,1,"Dobby, stop it! Stop it! Stop, Dobby! Tell me, Dobby. When did this happen before? Who's doing it now?"
1361,50,43,27,"Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby only wants Harry Potter to be safe."
1362,50,43,1,"No, Dobby. Tell me. Who is it?"
1363,50,43,85,Put him here. What happened?
1364,50,43,4,There's been another attack.
1365,50,43,7,"I think- do ya know- I think he's been Petrified, Madame Pomfrey. Look! Perhaps he managed to take a picture of his attacker"
1366,50,43,7,"What can this mean, Albus?"
1367,50,43,4,It meansthat our students are in great danger.
1368,50,43,7,What should I tell the staff.
1369,50,43,4,"The truth. Tell them Hogwarts is no longer safe. It is as we feared, Minerva. The Chamber of Secrets has indeed been opened again."
1370,51,46,3,Again? You mean the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?
1371,51,46,2,Of course. Don't you see? Lucius Malfoy must have opened it when he was at school here. And now he's taught Draco how to do it.
1372,51,46,3,Maybe. We'll have to wait for the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.
1373,51,46,2,"Enlighten me. Why are we brewing this potion in broad daylight, in the middle of a girl's lavatory? Don't you think we'll get caught?"
1374,51,46,3,Heh No. No one ever comes in here.
1375,51,46,2,Why?
1376,51,46,3,Moaning Myrtle.
1377,51,46,2,Who?
1378,51,46,3,Moaning Myrtle.
1379,51,46,2,Who's Moaning Myrtle?
1380,51,46,39,"I'm Moaning Myrtle! I wouldn't expect you to know me! Who would ever talk about ugly, miserable, moping Moaning Myrtle? Huhaaaah!"
1381,51,46,3,She's a little sensitive.
1382,51,36,28,"Gather 'round, gather 'round! Can everybody see me? Can you all hear me? Excellent! In light of the dark events of recent weeks, Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this little Dueling Club to train you all up in case you ever need to defend yourselves, as I myself have done on countless occasions- for full details, see my published works. Let me introduce my assistant, Professor Snape. He has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration. Now, I don't want any of you youngsters to worry- you'll still have your Potions master when I'm through with him, never fear. One, two, three."
1383,51,36,6,Expelliarmus!
1384,51,36,28,Whoaah!
1385,51,36,3,Do you think he's all right?
1386,51,36,2,Who cares?
1387,51,36,28,"An excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape, but if you don't mind me saying, it was pretty obvious- ah- what you were about to do. And if I had wanted to stop you, it would have been only too easy."
1388,51,36,6,"Perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students to block unfriendly spells, Professor."
1389,51,36,28,"An excellent suggestion, Professor Snape! Ah Let's have a volunteer pair! Um, Potter, Weasley, how about you?"
1390,51,36,6,"Weasley's wand causes devastation with the simplest spells. We'll be sending Potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox. Might I suggest someone from my own house? Malfoy, perhaps?"
1391,51,36,28,"Good luck, Potter."
1392,51,36,1,"Thank you, sir."
1393,51,36,28,Wands at the ready.
1394,51,36,12,"Scared, Potter?"
1395,51,36,1,You wish.
1396,51,36,28,"On the count of three, cast your charms to disarm your opponent- only to disarm. We don't want any accidents here. One, two--"
1397,51,36,12,Everte statium!
1398,51,36,3,Oh!
1399,51,36,80,"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!"
1400,51,36,1,Rictusempra!
1401,52,36,28,I said disarm only!
1402,52,36,12,Serpensortia!
1403,52,36,6,"Don't move, Potter. I'll get rid of it for you."
1404,52,36,28,"Allow me, Professor Snape. Alarte ascendare!"
1405,52,36,1,Sya- hassa- she. Sya- hasi- heth. Sya- hasi- heth.
1406,52,36,6,Vipera evanesca.
1407,52,36,109,What are you playing at?
1408,52,39,2,You're a Parselmouth? Why didn't you tell us?
1409,52,39,1,I'm a what?
1410,52,39,3,You can talk to snakes.
1411,52,39,1,"I know. I mean, I accidentally set a python on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once. Uh, once! But, so what? I bet loads of people here can do it."
1412,52,39,3,"No, they can't. It's not a very common gift, Harry. This is bad."
1413,52,39,1,What's bad? If I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin.
1414,52,39,2,"Oh, that's what you said to it!"
1415,52,39,1,You were there! You heard me!
1416,52,39,2,I heard you speaking Parseltongue. Snake language?
1417,52,39,1,I spoke a different language? But- I didn't realize I- how can I speak a language without knowing I can?
1418,52,39,3,"I don't know, Harry, but it sounded like you were egging the snake on, or something. Harry, listen to me. There's a reason the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent. Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth. He could talk to snakes, too."
1419,52,39,2,"Exactly! Now the whole school's gonna think you're his great- greatgreat grandson, or something."
1420,52,39,1,But I'm not I can't be.
1421,52,39,3,"He lived a thousand years ago; for all we know, you could be."
1422,52,28,1,I'll see you back in the common room.
1423,52,28,86,BloodI want bloodThey all must die. Kill Kill Kill! Time to kill.
1424,53,28,35,"Caught in the act! I'll have you out this time, Potter. Mark my words."
1425,53,28,1,No! Mr. Filch! Y-you- you don't understand!
1426,53,28,7,Oh!
1427,53,28,1,Professor I swear I didn't!
1428,53,28,7,"This is out of my hands, Potter."
1429,53,41,7,Professor Dumbledore will be waiting for you. Sherbet lemon.
1430,53,41,1,Professor Dumbledore?
1431,53,41,128,"Bee in your bonnet, Potter?"
1432,53,41,1,I I-I was- I was just wondering if you'd put me in the right house.
1433,53,41,128,"Yes, you were particularly difficult to place. But, I stand by what I said last year-- you would have done well in Slytherin."
1434,53,41,1,You're wrong.
1435,53,41,128,Umm
1436,53,41,4,Harry?
1437,53,41,1,"Professor! Sir, your bird- there was nothing I could do- he- he just caught fire!"
1438,53,41,4,"Oh, and about time, too. He's been looking dreadful for days. Pity you had to see him on a burning day. Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. They burst into flame when it is time for them to die, and then they are reborn from the ashes."
1439,53,41,4,"Ah, fascinating creatures, phoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy loads, and their- their tears have healing powers."
1440,53,41,5,"Professor Dumbledore, sir! Wait! Listen! Professor Dumbledore, sir, it wasn't Harry!"
1441,53,41,4,Hagrid.
1442,53,41,5,"In fact, I'd be prepared ter swear it in front o' the Ministry of Magic!"
1443,53,41,4,Hagrid! Relax. I do not believe that Harry attacked anyone.
1444,53,41,5,"Well, of course you don't, and Oh Oh, right. Well, I'll, umhum. I'll just wait outside, then."
1445,53,41,4,Yes.
1446,53,41,1,"You don't think it was me, Professor?"
1447,53,41,4,"No, Harry. I do not think it was you But I must ask you, is there something you wish to tell me?"
1448,53,41,1,"No, sir. Nothing."
1449,53,41,4,"Very well, then. Off you go."
1450,54,46,3,Everything's set. We just need a bit of who you're changing into.
1451,54,46,1,Crabbe and Goyle.
1452,54,46,3,We also need to make sure that the real Crabbe and Goyle can't burst in on us while we're interrogating Malfoy.
1453,54,46,2,How?
1454,54,46,3,"I've got it all worked out. I filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught. Simple, but powerful. Now, once they're asleep hide them in the broomstick cupboard and pull out a few of their hairs, and put on their uniforms."
1455,54,46,2,Whose hair are you ripping out then?
1456,54,46,3,I've already got mine. Millicent Bulstrodeâ Slytherin- I got this off her robes. I'm going to go check on the Polyjuice Potion. Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle find these.
1457,54,46,2,Ahem
1458,54,46,1,"Ron, maybe I should do it?"
1459,54,46,2,Yeah. Right.
1460,54,46,1,Wingardium leviosa. Here they come.
1461,54,46,80,It's good right? Ah Cool!
1462,54,46,80,Ummmum.
1463,54,46,99,Ummmum.
1464,54,46,2,How thick could you get?
1465,54,46,1,Come on. Let's get 'em.
1466,54,46,3,We'll have exactly one hour before we change back into ourselves Add the hairs.
1467,54,46,2,Ugh- essence of Crabbe.
1468,54,46,3,Cheers!
1469,54,46,2,I think I'm gonna be sick!
1470,54,46,3,Me too.
1471,54,46,1,Ughh!
1472,54,46,2,Uh Harry?
1473,54,46,1,Ron!
1474,54,46,2,Bloody hell!
1475,54,46,1,We still sound like ourselves. You need to sound more like Crabbe.
1476,54,46,2,Uh Bloody hell.
1477,54,46,1,Excellent.
1478,54,46,2,But where's Hermione?
1479,54,46,3,I- I don't think I'm going. You go on without me!
1480,54,46,1,"Hermione, are you okay?"
1481,54,46,3,Just go. You're wasting time!
1482,54,46,1,Come on.
1483,55,46,1,I think the Slytherin common room's this way.
1484,55,28,2,Okay.
1485,55,28,37,Excuse me.
1486,55,28,2,"What are you doing d- uh, I mean What are you doing down here?"
1487,55,28,37,"I happen to be a school prefect. You, on the other hand, have no business wandering the corridors at this time of night. What are your names again?"
1488,55,28,2,Uhh
1489,55,28,1,I'm
1490,55,28,12,"Crabbe, Goyle! Where have you two been? Pigging out in the Great Hall all this time? Why are you wearing glasses?"
1491,55,28,1,Ah- um Reading.
1492,55,28,12,Reading?
1493,55,28,1,Uh-huh.
1494,55,28,12,"I didn't know you could read. And what are you doing down here, Weasley?"
1495,55,28,37,"Mind your attitude, Malfoy."
1496,55,57,12,"Well, sit down. You'd never know the Weasleys were pure-bloods, the way they behave. They're an embarrassment to the wizarding world. All of them. What's wrong with you, Crabbe?"
1497,55,57,2,AhemStomachache.
1498,55,57,12,"You know, I'm surprised that the Daily Prophet hasn't done a report on all these attacks. I suppose Dumbledore is trying to hush it all up. Father always said Dumbledore was the worst thing that ever happened to this place."
1499,55,57,1,You're wrong!
1500,55,57,12,What? You think there's someone here who's worse than Dumbledore?
1501,55,57,1,Harry Potter?
1502,55,57,12,"Good one, Goyle. You're absolutely right. Saint Potter. And people actually think that he's the Heir of Slytherin!"
1503,55,57,1,But then you must have some idea who's behind it all.
1504,55,57,12,"You know I don't Goyle. I told you yesterday. How many times do I have to tell you? Is this yours? But my father did say this: It's been fifty years since the Chamber was opened. He wouldn't tell me who opened it-- only that they were expelled. The last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died. So, it's only a matter of time before one of them is killed this time. As for me, I hope it's Granger. What's the matter with you two? You're acting veryodd."
1505,55,57,1,It's his stomachache. Calm down.
1506,55,57,2,S- scar.
1507,55,57,1,Hair!
1508,55,57,12,Hey! Where are you going?
1509,55,46,2,That was close!
1510,55,46,1,"Hermione, come out. We've got loads to tell you!"
1511,55,46,3,Go away!
1512,55,46,39,"Ahh! Wait till you see. It's awful! He- ha, ha, he- hee!"
1513,55,46,1,Hermione? A- are you OK?
1514,55,46,39,Aaah!
1515,55,46,3,Do you remember me telling you that the Polyjuice Potion was only for human transformations? It was cat's hair I plucked off Millicent Bulstrode's robes. Look at my face.
1516,55,46,39,"Hee, ha, ha!"
1517,55,46,2,Look at your tail!
1518,55,46,39,"Ha, ha, ha!"
1519,56,46,2,Have you spoken to Hermione?
1520,56,46,1,"She should be out of hospital in a few days, when she stops coughing up fur balls What's this?"
1521,56,46,2,Yuck!
1522,56,46,1,Looks like Moaning Myrtle's flooded the bathroom.
1523,56,46,39,"Oooh, oooh, ooooh, huhâ huh. Come to throw something else at me?"
1524,56,46,1,Why would I throw something at you?
1525,56,46,39,"Don't ask me! Here I am, minding my own business, and someone thinks it's funny to throw a book at me."
1526,56,46,2,"But, it can't hurt if someone throws something at you. I mean, it'll just go right through you."
1527,56,46,39,Sure! Let's all throw books at Myrtle because she can't feel it! Ten points if you get through her stomach! Fifty points if it goes through her head!
1528,56,46,1,"But, who threw it at you, anyway?"
1529,56,46,39,"I don't know, I didn't see them. I was just sitting in the Ubend thinking about death - aah - and it fell through the top of my head. Uhhuh. Whoo-oooh-whoooo"
1530,56,39,1,'Tom Marvolo Riddle.'
1531,56,39,1,'My name is Harry Potter.'
1532,56,39,144,"Hello Harry Potter, my name is Tom Riddle."
1533,56,39,1,'Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets?'
1534,56,39,144,Yes.
1535,56,39,1,'Can you tell me?'
1536,56,39,144,No. But I can show you. Let me take you back fifty years ago
1537,57,60,1,Excuse me. Could you tell me what's going on here? Are you Tom Riddle?
1538,57,60,4,Riddle! Come.
1539,57,60,24,Professor Dumbledore.
1540,57,60,1,Dumbledore?
1541,57,60,4,"It is not wise to be wandering around this late hour, Tom."
1542,57,60,24,"Yes, Professor. I- I suppose I- I had to see for myself if the rumors were true."
1543,57,60,4,"I'm afraid they are, Tom. They are true."
1544,57,60,24,"About the school, as well? I don't have a home to go to. They wouldn't really close Hogwarts, would they Professor?"
1545,57,60,4,"I understand Tom, but I'm afraid Headmaster Dippet may have no choice."
1546,57,60,24,Sir- if it all stopped- if the person responsible was caught--
1547,57,60,4,Is there something you wish to tell me?
1548,57,60,24,"No, sir. Nothing."
1549,57,60,4,"Very well, then. Off you go."
1550,57,60,24,"Good night, sir."
1551,57,60,5,Let's get yeh out of there.
1552,57,60,24,"Evening, Hagrid. I'm going to have to turn you in, Hagrid. I don't think you meant it to kill anyone, but--"
1553,57,60,5,You can't! You don't understand.
1554,57,60,24,The dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do is make sure the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered.
1555,57,60,5,It wasn't him. Aragog never killed no one! Never!
1556,57,60,24,"Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid. Now, stand aside."
1557,57,60,5,No!
1558,57,60,24,"Stand aside, Hagrid!"
1559,57,60,5,No!
1560,57,60,24,Cistem aperio! Arania exumai!
1561,57,60,5,Aragog! Aragog!
1562,57,60,24,"I can't let you go. They'll have your wand for this, Hagrid. You'll be expelled."
1563,57,60,1,Hagrid! Haagriid!
1564,57,60,1,Woah!
1565,58,45,1,It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened the Chanter of Secrets fifty years ago.
1566,58,45,3,It can't be Hagrid. It just can't be.
1567,58,45,2,"We don't even know this Tom Riddle. He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch to me."
1568,58,45,1,"The monster had killed somebody, Ron. What would any of us have done?"
1569,58,45,3,Look. Hagrid's our friend. Why don't we just go and ask him about it?
1570,58,45,2,"That'll be a cheerful visit! Hello, Hagrid! Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?â"
1571,58,45,5,"Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be talking about me now, would ya?"
1572,58,45,1,No!
1573,58,45,2,No!
1574,58,45,3,No!
1575,58,45,1,"W- what's that you've got, Hagrid?"
1576,58,45,5,"Oh, It's a- Flesh-Eatin' Slug Repellent. For the Mandrakes, ya know. Now, accordin' to Professor Sprout, they've still got a bit o' growing up to do. But, once their acne's cleared up, we'll be able to chop 'em up and stew 'em, and then we'll get those people down at the hospital un-Petrified. In the meantime, though, you three had best be lookin' after yourselves. All right? Hmm."
1577,58,45,5,"Hello, Neville!"
1578,58,39,10,"Harry- I don't know who did it, but you'd better come! Come on!"
1579,58,39,3,It had to be a Gryffindor. Nobody else knows our password- unless it wasn't a student.
1580,58,39,2,"Who ever it was, they must have been looking for something."
1581,58,39,1,And they found it. Tom Riddle's diary is gone.
1582,58,51,46,"Alright, listen up. We play our game, Hufflepuff doesn't stand a"
1583,58,51,14,"And not to mention, they're dead scared that Harry'll Petrify them if they fly anywhere near him."
1584,58,51,46,"Well, that too. Professor McGonagall."
1585,58,51,7,This match has been cancelled.
1586,58,51,46,We can't cancel Quidditch.
1587,58,51,7,"Silence, Wood. You and your teammates will go to Gryffindor Tower, now. Potter, you and I will find Mr. Weasley. There's something the both of you have to see."
1588,58,43,7,"I warn you, this could be a wee bit of a shock."
1589,58,43,2,Hermione!
1590,58,43,7,"She was found near the Library, along with this. Does it mean anything to either of you?"
1591,58,43,1,No.
1592,58,43,7,"Could I have your attention please? Because of recent events, these new rules will be put into effect immediately. All students will return to their house common rooms by six o'clock every evening. All students will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. No exceptions.â I should tell you this: unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught, it is likely the school will be closed."
1593,58,43,1,"We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron. I can't believe it's him, but if he did set the monster loose last time, he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets, and that's a start."
1594,58,43,2,But you heard McGonagall! We're not allowed to leave the tower except for class.
1595,58,43,1,I think it's time to get my Dad's old cloak out again.
1596,59,40,5,Who's there? Hello? Hello?
1597,59,40,1,What's that for?
1598,59,40,5,"Oh, nothing. I- I was expecting, ah It doesn't matter- come on inI just made a pot o' tea."
1599,59,40,1,"Hagrid, are you okay?"
1600,59,40,5,I'm fine! I'm alright.
1601,59,40,1,Did you hear about Hermione?
1602,59,40,5,"Oh, yeah. I heard about that, all righ'."
1603,59,40,1,"Look, we have to ask you something. Do you know who's opened the Chamber of Secrets?"
1604,59,40,5,"What you had to understand about that is-  Quick under the cloak. Don't say a word. Be quiet, both o' you Professor Dumbledore, sir!"
1605,59,40,4,"Good evening, Hagrid. I wonder, could we?"
1606,59,40,5,Of course! Come in! Come in.
1607,59,40,2,"That's Dad's boss! Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic!"
1608,59,40,17,"Bad business, Hagrid. Very bad business. Had to come-- three attacks on Muggle-borns. Things have gone far enough. The Ministry's got to act."
1609,59,40,5,"Oh, but I never- you know I never, Professor!"
1610,59,40,4,"I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence."
1611,59,40,17,"Albus look, Hagrid's record is against him. I've got to take him."
1612,59,40,5,Take me? Take me where? Not Azkaban Prison?
1613,59,40,17,"I'm afraid we have no choice, Hagrid."
1614,59,40,23,"Already here, Fudge? Good"
1615,59,40,5,What're you doin' here? Get outta my house!
1616,59,40,23,"Believe me, I take absolutely no pleasure being inside your-- you call this a house? Huh! No. I simply called at the school, and was told the headmaster was here."
1617,59,40,4,"Well, what exactly is it that you want with me?"
1618,59,40,23,"The other governors and I have decided it's time for you to step aside. This is an order of suspension. You'll find all twelve signatures on it. I'm afraid we feel you've rather lost your touch. Well, what, with all these attacks, there'll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts. I can only imagine what an awful loss that would be to the school."
1619,59,40,5,"Yeh can' take Professor Dumbledore away. Take him away, an' the Muggle-borns won' stand a chance! You mark my words, there'll be killin's next!"
1620,59,40,23,You think so?
1621,59,40,4,"Calm yourself, Hagrid. If the governors desire my removal, I will, of course, step aside. However, you will find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it."
1622,59,40,23,Admirable sentiments. Shall we? Fudge!
1623,59,40,17,"Come, Hagrid Well?"
1624,59,40,5,"Ahem! If, uh, if anybody was looking for some stuff, then all they'd have to do would be to follow the spiders. Yup! That would lead them right! That's all I have to say. Oh, and someone'll need to feed Fang while I'm away."
1625,59,40,17,Good boy.
1626,59,40,2,"Hagrid's right! With Dumbledore gone, there'll be an attack a day!"
1627,59,40,1,"Look! Well, come on. Come on, Fang!"
1628,60,35,2,What?!
1629,60,35,1,You heard what Hagrid said; 'Follow the spiders.'
1630,60,35,2,They're headed to the Dark Forest! Why spiders! Why couldn't it be follow the butterflies?â
1631,60,35,2,"Harry, I don't like this Harry, I don't like this at all!"
1632,60,35,1,Shush!
1633,60,35,2,Can we go back now?
1634,60,35,1,Come on!
1635,60,35,68,Who is it?
1636,60,35,1,Don't panic.
1637,60,35,68,Hagrid? Is that you?
1638,60,35,1,We're friends of Hagrid's. And you? Y- y-you're Aragog aren't you?
1639,60,35,68,Yes. Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before.
1640,60,35,1,"He's in trouble. Up at the school, there have been attacks. They think it's Hagrid. They think he opened the Chamber of Secrets, like before."
1641,60,35,68,That's a lie! Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets.
1642,60,35,1,Then you're not the monster.
1643,60,35,68,"No! The monster was born in the castle. I came to Hagrid from a distant land, in the pocket of a traveler."
1644,60,35,2,Harry.
1645,60,35,1,"Shush. But if you're not the monster, then- then what did kill that girl fifty years ago?"
1646,60,35,68,We do not speak of it. It is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others.
1647,60,35,1,But have you seen it?
1648,60,35,68,"I never saw any part of the castle but the box in which Hagrid kept me. The girl was discovered in a bathroom. When I was accused, Hagrid brought me here."
1649,60,35,2,Harry!
1650,60,35,1,What?
1651,60,35,2,Ahh- hhh
1652,61,35,1,"Well, thank you. We'll justgo."
1653,61,35,68,"Go? I think not. My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid on my command. But I cannot deny them fresh meat when it wanders so willingly into our midst. Good-bye, friend of Hagrid."
1654,61,35,2,Can we panic now?
1655,61,35,2,Know any spells?
1656,61,35,1,"One, but it's not powerful enough for all of them."
1657,61,35,2,Where's Hermione when you need her?
1658,61,35,1,Let's go! Arania exumai! Go!
1659,61,35,1,Whoah!
1660,61,35,2,Whoah!
1661,61,35,2,Glad we're out of there! Ah- Aaaah!
1662,61,35,1,Arania exumai!
1663,61,35,2,Thanks for that.
1664,61,35,1,Don't mention it. Get us out of here. Now! Come on! Come on! Move faster!
1665,61,35,1,Aah!
1666,61,35,2,Aah!
1667,61,35,1,Go on! Go! Get us in the air.
1668,61,35,2,The flying gear's jammed!
1669,61,35,1,Come on! Pull!
1670,61,35,2,I'm trying!
1671,61,35,2,"Follow the spiders! Follow the spiders! If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban, I'll kill him! I mean, what was the point of sending us in there? What have we found out?"
1672,61,35,1,We know one thing. Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets. He was innocent.
1673,62,43,1,"Wish you were here Hermione. We need you now, more than ever."
1674,62,43,2,What's that?
1675,62,43,1,"Ron, this is why Hermione was in the Library the day she was attacked. Come on!"
1676,62,43,1,"'Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land, none is more deadly than the basilisk. Capable of living for hundreds of years, instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye. Spiders flee before it.' Ron, this is it. The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a basilisk. That's why I can hear it speak. It's a snake!"
1677,62,43,2,"But if it kills by looking people in the eye, why is it no one's dead?"
1678,62,43,1,"Because no one did look it in the eye. Not directly, at least. Colin saw it through his camera. JustinJustin must have seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick. Nick got the full blast of it- but he's a ghost- he couldn't die again. And Hermionehad the mirror. I bet you anything she was using it to look around corners, in case it came along."
1679,62,43,2,"And Mrs. Norris? I'm pretty sure she didn't have a camera or a mirror, Harry."
1680,62,43,1,The water. There was water on the floor that night. She only saw the basilisk's reflection. 'Spiders flee before it.' It all fits!
1681,62,43,2,But how's a basilisk been getting around? A dirty great snake- someone would have seen it.
1682,62,43,1,"Hermione's answered that, too."
1683,62,43,2,Pipes? It's using the plumbing!
1684,62,43,1,"Remember what Aragog said, about that girl fifty years ago? She died in a bathroom? What if she never left?"
1685,62,43,2,Moaning Myrtle.
1686,62,28,7,"All students are to return to their house dormitories at once. All teachers to the second floor corridor, immediately."
1687,62,28,7,"As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin has left another message. Our worst fear has been realized. A student has been taken by the monster into the Chamber itself. The students must be sent home. I'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts."
1688,62,28,28,So sorry- dozed off- what have I missed?
1689,62,28,6,"A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Your moment has come, at last."
1690,62,28,28,My m-moment?
1691,62,28,6,Weren't you saying just last night that you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?
1692,62,28,7,"Well, that's settled. We'll leave you to deal with the monster, Gilderoy. Your skills, after all, are a legend."
1693,62,28,28,"Very well- ah- I'll just be in my office getting, umgetting ready."
1694,62,28,85,"Who is it that the monster's taken, Minerva?"
1695,62,28,7,Ginny Weasley.
1696,62,28,2,Her skeleton will lie in the chamber forever.' Ginny
1697,63,30,1,"Lockhart may be useless, but he's going to try and get into the Chamber. At least we can tell him what we know."
1698,63,30,1,"Professor, we have some information for you! Are you going somewhere?"
1699,63,30,28,"Uh, ah- well, yes- um, urgent call- unavoidable- got to go."
1700,63,30,2,What about my sister?!
1701,63,30,28,"Well, um- as to that, most unfortunate. No one regrets more than I."
1702,63,30,2,You're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher! You can't go now!
1703,63,30,28,Well- I must say- when I took the job there was nothing in the job description about a
1704,63,30,1,You're running away? After all that stuff you did in your books?
1705,63,30,28,Books can be misleading!
1706,63,30,1,You wrote them!
1707,63,30,28,"My dear boy, do use your common sense! My books wouldn't have sold half as well if people didn't think I'd done all those things!"
1708,63,30,1,You're a fraud! You've just been taking credit for what other wizards have done!
1709,63,30,2,Is there anything you can do?
1710,63,30,28,"Yes, now you mention it. I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms. Otherwise, you see, all those wizards would have gone blabbing. And I'd never have sold another book. In fact, ahI'm ahgoing to have to do the same to you."
1711,63,30,1,Don't even think about it.
1712,63,46,39,"Oh! Who's there? Oh! Hello, Harry! Ron. What do you want?"
1713,63,46,1,To ask you how you died.
1714,63,46,39,"Oh! It was dreadful. It happened right here in this very cubicle. I'd hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses. I was crying, and then I heard somebody come in."
1715,63,46,1,Who was it Myrtle?
1716,63,46,39,"I don't know. I was Distraught! Huhh-huhBut they said something funny, a kind of made up language. And I realized it was a boy speaking, so I unlocked the door to tell him to go away and I died."
1717,63,46,1,Just like that? How?
1718,63,46,39,"I just remember seeing a pair of great big yellow eyesover there, by that sink. Ohhhhooo"
1719,63,46,1,"This is it. This is it, Ron. I think this is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets."
1720,63,46,2,"Say something. Harry, say something in Parseltongue!"
1721,63,46,1,Hesha- Hassah.
1722,63,46,28,"Excellent, Harry. Haa! Good work! Well then, I'll just be, ah There's no need for me to stay."
1723,63,46,1,"Oh, yes there is! You first."
1724,63,46,28,"Now, boys what good will it do?"
1725,63,46,2,Better you than us.
1726,63,46,28,"Umbutobviously, yes. Sure you don't want to test it first? No! Aaaah! It's really quite filthy down here."
1727,63,46,1,All right. Let's go.
1728,63,46,39,"Oh, Harry? If you die down there, you're welcome to share my toilet. Hee, hee."
1729,63,46,1,Uhthanks Myrtle.
1730,63,46,1,Aaah!
1731,63,46,2,Aaah!
1732,63,25,2,Ugh!
1733,63,25,1,"Now remember, any sign of movement, close your eyes straightaway."
1734,63,25,2,Go on.
1735,64,25,1,This way.
1736,64,25,2,What's this?
1737,64,25,28,It looks like a snake.
1738,64,25,1,It's a snakeskin.
1739,64,25,2,"Bloody hell. Whatever shed this must be sixty feet long-- or more! Heart of a lion, this one."
1740,64,25,28,"The adventure ends here, boys. But don't fret. The world will know our story. How I was too late to save the girl. How you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body. So, you first, Mr. Potter. Say good-bye to your memories. Obliviate!"
1741,64,25,2,Harry! Harry!
1742,64,25,1,"Ron! Ron, are you ok?"
1743,64,25,2,I'm fine!
1744,64,25,28,Uhh Hello. Who are you?
1745,64,25,2,UmRon Weasley.
1746,64,25,28,"Really? And uh, who- who am I?"
1747,64,25,2,Lockhart's memory charm backfired. He hasn't got a clue who he is!
1748,64,25,28,"It's an odd sort of place this, isn't it? Do you live here?"
1749,64,25,2,No!
1750,64,25,28,Really? Well?
1751,64,25,2,What'll do I do now?
1752,64,25,1,You wait here and try and shift some of this rock so we can get back through. I'll go on and find Ginny!
1753,64,25,2,OK.
1754,64,25,1,Hesha- Hassah.
1755,65,25,1,"Ginny Ginny! Oh, Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up. Wake up! Please, wake up!"
1756,65,25,24,She won't wake.
1757,65,25,1,"Tom. Tom Riddle! What do you mean, 'she won't wake?' She's not?"
1758,65,25,24,"She's still alive, but only just."
1759,65,25,1,Are you a ghost?
1760,65,25,24,"A memory, preserved in a diary for fifty years."
1761,65,25,1,"She's cold as ice. Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up! You've got to help me, Tom. There's a basilisk."
1762,65,25,24,It won't come until it's called.
1763,65,25,1,"Give me my wand, Tom."
1764,65,25,24,You won't be needing it.
1765,65,25,1,"Listen, we've got to go! We've got to save her!"
1766,65,25,24,"I'm afraid I can't do that, Harry. You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker, I grow stronger. Yes Harry, it was Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets."
1767,65,25,1,No. She couldn't. She wouldn't!
1768,65,25,24,"It was Ginny who set the basilisk on the Mudbloods and Filch's cat, Ginny who wrote the threatening messages on the walls."
1769,65,25,1,But why?
1770,65,25,24,"Because I told her to. You'll find that I can be very persuasive. Not that she knew what she was doing. She was, shall we say, in a kind of trance. Still, the power of the diary began to scare her. And she tried to dispose of it in the girl's bathroom. And then, who should find it, but you? The very person I was most anxious to meet."
1771,65,25,1,"But, why did you want to meet me?"
1772,65,25,24,"I knew I had to talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf, Hagrid, to gain your trust."
1773,65,25,1,"Hagrid's my friend! And you framed him, didn't you?"
1774,65,25,24,It was my word against Hagrid's. Only Dumbledore seemed to think he was innocent.
1775,65,25,1,I'll bet Dumbledore saw right through you.
1776,65,25,24,"He certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that. I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school, so I decided to leave behind a diary preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages, so that one day I would be able to lead another to finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work."
1777,65,25,1,"Well, you haven't finished it this time. In a few hours, the Mandrake Draught will be ready, and everyone who was Petrified will be all right again."
1778,65,25,24,"Haven't I told you? Killing Mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore. For many months now, my new target has been you. How is it that a baby, with no extraordinary magical talent, was able to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? How did you escape with nothing but a scar, while Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed?"
1779,65,25,1,Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time.
1780,65,25,24,"Voldemort is my past, present, and future."
1781,65,25,1,You! You're the Heir of Slytherin. You're Voldemort.
1782,65,25,24,"Surely, you didn't think I was going to keep my filthy Muggle father's name? No. I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak, when I became the greatest sorcerer in the world."
1783,65,25,1,Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world!
1784,65,25,24,Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me!
1785,65,25,1,He'll never be gone! Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him! Fawkes?
1786,65,25,24,"So, this is what Dumbledore sends his great defender, a songbird and an old hat. Shearhas- Samnathas- SÃ©lithaeine."
1787,66,25,24,"Let's match the power of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against the famous Harry Potter. Sethae- He- This. Parseltongue won't save you now, Potter. It only obeys me!"
1788,66,25,24,"No! Your bird may have blinded the basilisk, but it can still hear you!"
1789,66,25,24,"Yes, Potter, the process is nearly complete. In a few minutes Ginny will be dead, and I will cease to be a memory. Lord Voldemort will return- very much alive!"
1790,66,25,1,Ginny-
1791,67,25,24,"Remarkable isn't it, how quickly the venom of the basilisk penetrates the body? I'd guess you have little more than a minute to live. You'll be with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry. Funny, the damage a silly little book can do especially in the hands of a silly, little girl. What are you doing? Stop! No! Ahhhh! Ahhhh! Ahhhh!"
1792,67,25,1,Ginny
1793,67,25,20,"Harry. It was me- but I swear, I didn't mean to! Riddle made me, and Harry, you're hurt!"
1794,67,25,1,"Don't worry. Ginny, you need to get yourself out. Follow the Chamber, and you'll find Ron. You were brilliant, Fawkes. I just wasn't quick enough Of course! Phoenix tears have healing powers. Thanks! It's alright, Ginny. It's over. It's just a memory."
1795,67,25,28,Amazing! This is just like magic!
1796,68,41,4,"You both realize, of course, that in the past few hours you have broken perhaps a dozen school rules?"
1797,68,41,1,"Yes, sir."
1798,68,41,2,"Yes, sir."
1799,68,41,4,And there is sufficient evidence to have you both expelled.
1800,68,41,1,"Yes, sir."
1801,68,41,2,"Yes, sir."
1802,68,41,4,"Therefore, it is only fitting, that you both receive Special Awards for Services to the School."
1803,68,41,2,"Thanks, sir!"
1804,68,41,4,"And now, Mr. Weasley, if you would, have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban? I believe we- we want our gamekeeper back. Harry first, I want to thank you, Harry. You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you. And, um second, I sense that something is troubling you. Am I right, Harry?"
1805,68,41,1,"It's just You see, sir I- I couldn't help but notice certain things, certain- certain similarities, between Tom Riddle and me."
1806,68,41,4,"I see. Well, you can speak Parseltongue, Harry. Why? Because Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue. If I'm not mistaken, Harry, he transferred some of his powers to you the night he gave you that scar."
1807,68,41,1,Voldemort transferred some of his powers to me?
1808,68,41,4,"Not intentionally, but yes."
1809,68,41,1,So the Sorting Hat was right! I should be in Slytherin.
1810,68,41,4,"It's true, Harry. You possess many of the qualities that Voldemort himself prizes. Determination, resourcefulness, and if I may say so, a certain disregard for the rules. Why then did the Sorting Hat place you in Gryffindor?"
1811,68,41,1,Because I asked it to.
1812,68,41,4,"Exactly, Harry! Exactly! Which makes you different from Voldemort. It is not our abilities that show what we truly are. It is our choices. If you want proof why you belong in Gryffindor, then I suggest that you look more closely at this. Be careful."
1813,68,41,1,Godric Gryffindor.
1814,68,41,4,Ah- it would take a true Gryffindor to pull that out of the hat.
1815,69,41,1,Dobby! So this is your master! The family you serve is the Malfoys
1816,69,41,27,Um-humm
1817,69,41,23,"I'll deal with you later. Out of my way, Potter! So, it's true-- you have returned!"
1818,69,41,4,"When the governors learned that Arthur Weasley's daughter was taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back."
1819,69,41,23,Ridiculous!
1820,69,41,4,"Curiously, Lucius, several of them were under the impression that you would curse their families, if they did not agree to suspend me in the first place."
1821,69,41,23,How dare you?!
1822,69,41,4,I beg your pardon?
1823,69,41,23,"My sole concern has always been, and will always be, the welfare of this school and, of course, its students. The culprit has been identified, I presume?"
1824,69,41,4,"Oh, yes."
1825,69,41,23,And? Who was it?
1826,69,41,4,Voldemort.
1827,69,41,23,Ah!
1828,69,41,4,"Only, this time, he chose to act through somebody else, by means of this."
1829,69,41,23,I see.
1830,69,41,4,"Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it. One hopes that no more of Lord Voldemort's old school things should find their way into innocent hands. The consequences for the one responsible would be severe."
1831,69,41,23,"Well, let us hope that Mr. Potter will always be around to save the day."
1832,69,41,1,Don't worry. I will be.
1833,69,41,23,"Dumbledore. Come, Dobby. We're leaving."
1834,69,41,27,Ahh! Oow!
1835,69,41,1,"Sir, I wonder if I could have that?"
1836,69,41,1,Mr. Malfoy! Mr. Malfoy! I have something of yours.
1837,69,41,23,Mine? I don't know what you're talking about.
1838,69,41,1,"Oh, I think you do, sir. I think you slipped the diary into Ginny Weasley's cauldron, that day at Diagon Alley."
1839,69,41,23,"You do, do you? Why don't you prove it? Come, Dobby. Dobby!"
1840,69,41,1,Open it.
1841,69,41,23,Dobby?
1842,69,41,27,Master has given Dobby a sock!
1843,69,41,23,What? I didn't give.
1844,69,41,27,Master has presented Dobby with clothes! Dobby is free!
1845,69,41,23,You've lost me my servant!
1846,69,41,27,You shall not harm Harry Potter!
1847,69,41,23,Advada.
1848,69,41,23,"Your parents were meddlesome fools, too. You mark my words, Potter, one day soon you are going to meet the same sticky end!"
1849,69,41,27,Harry Potter freed Dobby! How can Dobby ever repay him?
1850,69,41,1,Just promise me something.
1851,69,41,27,"Anything, sir!"
1852,69,41,1,Never try to save my life again.
1853,70,36,126,"Welcome back, Sir Nicholas!"
1854,70,36,47,Thank you!
1855,70,36,126,"Good evening, Sir Nicholas!"
1856,70,36,47,Good evening!
1857,70,36,126,"Good to see you, Sir Nicholas!"
1858,70,36,47,Thank you! Hello! Hermione! Welcome back!
1859,70,36,3,"Thanks, Sir Nicholas!"
1860,70,36,10,Harry- it's Hermione!
1861,70,36,2,"Uhh-um Welcome back, Hermione."
1862,70,36,3,It's good to be back! Congratulations! I can't believe you solved it!
1863,70,36,1,"Well, we had loads of help from you. We couldn't have done it without you."
1864,70,36,3,Thanks.
1865,70,36,7,"Could I have your attention, please?"
1866,70,36,4,"Before we begin the feast, let us have a round of applause for Professor Sprout and Madame Pomfrey, whose Mandrake juice has been so successfully administered to all who had been Petrified. Also, in light of the recent events, as a school treat, all exams have been canceled."
1867,70,36,3,"Oh, no!"
1868,70,36,5,"Sorry I'm late! The owl that delivered my release papers got all lost and confused. Some ruddy bird called Errol. And I'd just like to say that aif it hadn't been for you, Harry, and Ron, and Hermione, o' course, I woulduh- I'd still be you-know-where, so I- I'd just like to say 'Thanks.'"
1869,70,36,1,"Well, there's no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid."
1870,70,36,5,Oh!
1871,70,36,127,Yeah! Yeah!
1872,71,8,1,Lumos Maxima. Lumos Maxima. Lumos Maxima. Lumos Maxima. Lumos Maxima!
1873,72,8,32,"Harry! Harry! Harry, open the door! Marge! How lovely to see..."
1874,72,8,1,"Uncle Vernon, I need you to sign this form."
1875,72,8,21,What is it?
1876,72,8,1,Nothing. School stuff.
1877,72,8,21,"Later perhaps, if you behave."
1878,72,8,1,I will if she does.
1879,72,8,60,"Oh, you're still here, are you?"
1880,72,8,1,Yes.
1881,72,8,60,"Don't say yes in that ungrateful way. Damn good of my brother to keep you. He'd have been straight to an orphanage if he'd been dumped on my doorstep. Is that my Dudders? Is that my little neffy-pooh? Give us a kiss! Come on! Up, up!"
1882,72,8,21,Take Marge's suitcase upstairs!
1883,72,8,1,Okay.
1884,72,8,60,"Finish that off for Mommy. Good boy, Rippy-pooh."
1885,72,8,21,"Can I tempt you, Marge?"
1886,72,8,60,"Just a small one. Excellent nosh, Petunia. A bit more. Usually just a fry-up for me, what with 12 dogs. Just a bit more. That's a boy! Mm! You wanna try a little drop of brandy? A little drop of brandy-brandy windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh? What are you smirking at? Where did you send the boy, Vernon?"
1887,72,8,21,St. Brutus'. It's a fine institution for hopeless cases.
1888,72,8,60,"Do they use a cane at St. Brutus', boy?"
1889,72,8,1,"Oh, yeah. Yeah. I've been beaten loads of times."
1890,72,8,60,"Excellent. I won't have this namby-pamby... wishy-washy nonsense about not beating people who deserve it. You mustn't blame yourself about how this one turned out. It's all to do with blood. Bad blood will out. What is it the boy's father did, Petunia?"
1891,72,8,32,Nothing. He didn't work. He was unemployed.
1892,72,8,60,"And a drunk too, no doubt?"
1893,72,8,1,That's a lie!
1894,72,8,60,What did you say?
1895,72,8,1,My dad wasn't a drunk!
1896,72,8,60,"Oh, don't worry Don't fuss, Petunia. I have a very firm grip."
1897,72,8,21,I think it's time you went to bed.
1898,72,8,60,"Quiet, Vernon. You, clean it up. Actually, it's nothing to do with the father. It's all to do with the mother. You see it all the time with dogs. If there's something wrong with the bitch, then there's something wrong with the pup."
1899,72,8,1,Shut up! Shut up!
1900,72,8,60,"Mm. Right! Let me tell you... y-y-- Vernon! Vernon! Vernon, do something!"
1901,72,8,21,"Ow! Ripper! Ow! Ripper, get down, boy! Down! Ripper, stop it! Stop! I've got you, Marge! I've got you! Hold on, hold on! Get off!"
1902,72,8,60,Don't you dare!
1903,72,8,21,Sorry!
1904,72,8,32,"Oh, Vernon!"
1905,72,8,21,"Oh, God! Marge! Please! Marge! Come back! You bring her back! You bring her back now and you put her right!"
1906,72,8,1,No! She deserved what she got! Keep away from me.
1907,72,8,21,You're not allowed to do magic outside school.
1908,72,8,1,Yeah? Try me.
1909,72,8,21,They won't let you back now. You've nowhere to go.
1910,72,8,1,I don't care. Anywhere's better than here.
1911,73,69,58,"Welcome to the Knight Bus... emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard. My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor for this evening. What you doing down there?"
1912,73,69,1,I fell over.
1913,73,69,58,What you fall over for?
1914,73,69,1,I didn't do it on purpose.
1915,73,69,58,"Well, come on, then. Let's not wait for the grass to grow. What you looking at?"
1916,73,69,1,Nothing.
1917,73,69,58,"Well, come on, then. In. No, no, no. I'll get this. You get in. Come on. Come on. Move on, move on, move on."
1918,73,69,58,"Take her away, Ern."
1919,73,69,133,"Yeah, take it away, Ernie. It's going to be a bumpy ride."
1920,73,69,58,What did you say your name was again?
1921,73,69,1,I didn't.
1922,73,69,58,Whereabouts are you headed?
1923,73,69,1,The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.
1924,73,69,58,You heard that Ern? The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.
1925,73,69,133,The Leaky Cauldron. If you have pea soup... make sure you eat it before it eats you.
1926,73,69,1,But the Muggles. Can't they see us?
1927,73,69,58,"Muggles? They don't see nothing, do they?"
1928,73,69,133,"No, but if you jab them with a fork, they feel. Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock! Ten, nine, eight... seven, six, five... four, three, three and a half... two, one and three quarters. Yes!"
1929,73,69,1,Who is that? That man.
1930,73,69,58,"Who is that? Who is...? That is Sirius Black, that is. Don't tell me you've never been hearing of Sirius Black. He's a murderer. Got himself locked up in Azkaban for it."
1931,73,69,1,How did he escape?
1932,73,69,58,"Well, that's the question, isn't it? He's the first one that done it. He was a big supporter of... You-Know-Who. I reckon you've heard of him."
1933,73,69,1,Yeah. Him I've heard of.
1934,73,69,133,"Ernie, two double-deckers at 12 o'clock. They're getting closer, Ernie. Ernie, they're right on top of us! Mind your head. Hey, guys? Guys? Why the long faces? Yeah, yeah. Nearly there. Nearly there. The Leaky Cauldron. Next stop, Knockturn Alley."
1935,74,5,92,"Ah, Mr. Potter, at last."
1936,74,5,58,"Take it away, Ern."
1937,74,5,133,"Yeah, take it away, Ernie!"
1938,74,5,92,: Room 11.
1939,74,5,1,Hedwig.
1940,74,5,17,": Right smart bird you got there, Mr. Potter. He arrived here just five minutes before yourself."
1941,74,5,17,"As Minister for Magic, it is my duty to inform you, Mr. Potter... that earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located... a little south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack. The Accidental Magic Reversal Department was dispatched immediately. She has been properly punctured and her memory modified. She will have no recollection of the incident whatsoever. So that's that... and no harm done."
1942,74,5,92,: Pea soup?
1943,74,5,1,"No, thank you. Minister?"
1944,74,5,17,Yes?
1945,74,5,1,I don't understand.
1946,74,5,17,Understand?
1947,74,5,1,I broke the law. Underage wizards can't use magic at home.
1948,74,5,17,"Come now, Harry the Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban... for blowing up their aunts. On the other hand, running away like that, given the state of things... was very, very irresponsible."
1949,74,5,1,"The state of things, sir?"
1950,74,5,17,We have a killer on the loose.
1951,74,5,1,"Sirius Black, you mean? But what's he got to do with me?"
1952,74,5,17,"Nothing, of course. You're safe. And that's what matters. And tomorrow you'll be on your way back to Hogwarts. These are your new schoolbooks. I took the liberty... of having them brought here. Now Tom will show you to your room."
1953,74,5,1,Hedwig.
1954,74,5,17,"Oh, by the way, Harry. Whilst you're here, it would be best if you didn't... wander."
1955,75,5,160,Housekeeping. I'll come back later.
1956,75,5,2,"I'm warning you, Hermione. Keep that bloody beast of yours away from Scabbers, or I'll turn it into a tea cozy."
1957,75,5,3,"It's a cat, Ronald. What do you expect? It's in his nature."
1958,75,5,2,A cat? Is that what they told you? Looks more like a pig with hair.
1959,75,5,3,"That's rich... coming from the owner of that smelly old shoe brush. Crookshanks, just ignore the mean little boy."
1960,75,5,2,Harry.
1961,75,5,3,Harry.
1962,75,5,1,Egypt. What's it like?
1963,75,5,2,"Brilliant. Loads of old stuff... like mummies, tombs, even Scabbers enjoyed himself."
1964,75,5,3,You know the Egyptians used to worship cats?
1965,75,5,2,Along with the dung beetle.
1966,75,5,14,Not flashing that clipping again are you Ron?
1967,75,5,19,Not flashing that clipping again are you Ron?
1968,75,5,2,I haven't shown anyone.
1969,75,5,14,"': No, not a soul. Not unless you count Tom. The day maid. The night maid. The Cook. The bloke who fixed the toilet. And that wizard from Belgium."
1970,75,5,19,"': No, not a soul. Not unless you count Tom. The day maid. The night maid. The Cook. The bloke who fixed the toilet. And that wizard from Belgium."
1971,75,5,26,Harry.
1972,75,5,1,Mrs. Weasley.
1973,75,5,26,"Good to see you, dear."
1974,75,5,1,Good to see you.
1975,75,5,26,You got everything you need?
1976,75,5,1,Yes.
1977,75,5,26,Yes? All of your books?
1978,75,5,1,"Yeah, it's all upstairs."
1979,75,5,26,All of your clothes?
1980,75,5,1,Everything's there.
1981,75,5,26,Good boy.
1982,75,5,1,Thank you.
1983,75,5,16,Harry Potter.
1984,75,5,1,Mr. Weasley.
1985,75,5,16,"Harry, wonder if I might have a word?"
1986,75,5,1,"Yeah, sure."
1987,75,5,16,Hermione.
1988,75,5,3,"Good morning, Mr. Weasley."
1989,75,5,16,Looking forward to a new term?
1990,75,5,1,Yeah. It should be great.
1991,75,5,16,"Harry, some within the Ministry would strongly discourage me... from divulging what I'm about to reveal to you. But I think that you need to know the facts. You are in danger. Grave danger."
1992,75,5,1,"Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir?"
1993,75,5,16,"What do you know about Sirius Black, Harry?"
1994,75,5,1,Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
1995,75,5,16,"Do you know why? Thirteen years ago, when you stopped..."
1996,75,5,1,Voldemort.
1997,75,5,16,Don't say his name.
1998,75,5,1,Sorry.
1999,75,5,16,"When you stopped You-Know-Who... Black lost everything. But to this day, he still remains a faithful servant. And in his mind... you are the only thing that stands in the way... of You-Know-Who returning to power. And that is why... he has escaped from Azkaban. To find you."
2000,75,5,1,And kill me.
2001,75,5,16,"Harry, swear to me that whatever you might hear... you won't go looking for Black."
2002,75,5,1,Mr. Weasley... why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?
2003,76,42,26,"Quick. Quick. Ron, Ron! Oh, for goodness' sake! Don't lose him!"
2004,76,42,1,I didn't mean to blow her up. I just... I lost control.
2005,76,42,2,Brilliant.
2006,76,42,3,"Honestly, Ron, it's not funny. Harry was lucky not to be expelled."
2007,76,42,1,I think I was lucky not to be arrested actually.
2008,76,42,2,I still think it was brilliant.
2009,76,42,3,Come on. Everywhere else is full.
2010,76,42,2,Who do you think that is?
2011,76,42,3,Professor R.J. Lupin.
2012,76,42,2,Do you know everything? How is it she knows everything?
2013,76,42,3,"It's on his suitcase, Ronald."
2014,76,42,2,Oh.
2015,76,42,1,Do you think he's really asleep?
2016,76,42,3,Seems to be. Why?
2017,76,42,1,I gotta tell you something.
2018,76,42,2,Let me get this straight. Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban to come after you?
2019,76,42,1,Yeah.
2020,76,42,3,"But they'll catch Black, won't they? I mean, everyone's looking for him."
2021,76,42,2,"Sure. Except no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before... and he's a murderous, raving lunatic."
2022,76,42,1,"Thanks, Ron."
2023,76,42,3,Why are we stopping? We can't be there yet.
2024,76,42,2,What's going on?
2025,76,42,1,I don't know. Maybe we've broken down.
2026,76,42,3,"Ouch, Ron. That was my foot."
2027,76,42,2,There's something moving out there. I think... someone's coming aboard.
2028,76,42,2,Bloody hell! What's happening?
2029,76,42,3,"Harry. Harry, are you all right?"
2030,76,42,1,Thank you.
2031,76,42,11,"Here, eat this. It'll help. It's all right. It's chocolate."
2032,76,42,1,What was that thing that came?
2033,76,42,11,"It was a dementor. One of the guards of Azkaban. It's gone now. It was searching the train for Sirius Black. If you'll excuse me, I need to have a little word with the driver. Eat. You'll feel better."
2034,76,42,1,What happened to me?
2035,76,42,2,"Well, you sort of went rigid. We thought maybe you were having a fit or something."
2036,76,42,1,And did either of you two... you know... pass out?
2037,76,42,2,"No. I felt weird, though. Like I'd never be cheerful again."
2038,76,42,1,But someone was screaming. A woman.
2039,76,42,3,"No one was screaming, Harry."
2040,77,36,4,"Welcome! Welcome to another year at Hogwarts! Now, I'd like to say a few words... before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast. First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin... who's kindly consented to fill the post... of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Good luck, Professor."
2041,77,36,3,"Of course. That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry."
2042,77,36,12,"Potter. Is it true you fainted? I mean, you actually fainted?"
2043,77,36,2,"Shove off, Malfoy."
2044,77,36,1,How did he find out?
2045,77,36,3,Just forget it.
2046,77,36,4,"Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher... has decided to retire... in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs. Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce... that his place will be taken by none other... than our own Rubeus Hagrid. Finally, on a more disquieting note... at the request of the Ministry of Magic... Hogwarts will, until further notice, play host to the dementors of Azkaban... until such a time as Sirius Black is captured. The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds. Now whilst I've been assured... that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities... a word of caution. Dementors are vicious creatures. They'll not distinguish... between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way. Therefore, I must warn each and every one of you... to give them no reason to harm you. It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving. But you know, happiness can be found... even in the darkest of times... if one only remembers to turn on the light."
2047,77,39,29,"Fortuna Major. Here, listen. She just won't let me in. Fortuna Major."
2048,77,39,141,"No, no, no. Wait, wait. Watch this. Oh, amazing! Just with my voice."
2049,77,39,1,Fortuna Major.
2050,77,39,141,"Yes, all right. Go in."
2051,77,39,1,Thank you.
2052,77,39,1,"She's still doing that after three years. She can't even sing. Exactly. Hey, man. Hey, man. Oh, God. That's awful."
2053,77,39,29,"She's still doing that after three years. She can't even sing. Exactly. Hey, man. Hey, man. Oh, God. That's awful."
2054,77,39,2,". Green. That's a monkey. What is that? You call that a monkey? Do not give him one again. Hey, Neville, try an elephant."
2055,77,39,29,"Ron, catch."
2056,77,39,2,I will.
2057,77,39,29,I think we have a winner.
2058,77,39,2,"Oh, don't try one of them. Oh, no. Look at him. His face."
2059,78,32,38,"Welcome, my children. In this room, you shall explore the noble art of Divination. In this room, you shall discover if you possess the Sight. Hello. I am Professor Trelawney. Together we shall cast ourselves into the future. This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy, the art of reading tea leaves. So please, take the cup of the person sitting opposite you. What do you see? The truth lies buried like a sentence deep within a book, waiting to be read. But first, you must broaden your minds. First, you must look beyond."
2060,78,32,3,What a load of rubbish.
2061,78,32,2,Where did you come from?
2062,78,32,3,Me? I've been here all this time.
2063,78,32,38,"You, boy... Is your grandmother quite well?"
2064,78,32,10,I think so.
2065,78,32,38,"I wouldn't be so sure of that. Give me the cup. Pity. Broaden your minds. Your aura is pulsing, dear. Are you in the beyond? I think you are."
2066,78,32,2,Sure.
2067,78,32,38,Look at the cup. Tell me what you see.
2068,78,32,2,"Oh, yeah. Um... Well, Harry's got sort of a wonky cross. That's trials and suffering. And that there could be the sun and that's happiness. So... you're gonna suffer, but you're gonna be... happy about it."
2069,78,32,38,"Give me the cup. Oh, my dear boy. My dear... you have the Grim."
2070,78,32,126,"The Grin? What's the Grin? Not the Grin, you idiot. The Grim. Taking form of a giant spectral dog. It's among the darkest omens in our world. It's an omen... of death."
2071,78,40,2,You don't think that Grim thing's got anything to do with Sirius Black?
2072,78,40,3,"Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me, Divination's a woolly discipline. Now, Ancient Runes, that's a fascinating subject."
2073,78,40,2,Ancient Runes? Exactly how many classes are you taking?
2074,78,40,3,A fair few.
2075,78,40,2,Hang on. That's not possible. Ancient Runes is in the same time as Divination. You have to be in two classes at once.
2076,78,40,3,Don't be silly Ron. How could anyone be in two classes at once? Broaden your minds. Use your Inner Eye to see the future!.
2077,79,40,5,"That's it. Come on, now. Come closer. Less talking, if you don't mind. I got a real treat for you today. A great lesson. So follow me. Right, you lot. Less chattering. Form a group over there. And open your books to page 49."
2078,79,40,12,Exactly how do we do that?
2079,79,40,5,"Just stroke the spine, of course. Goodness me."
2080,79,40,12,"Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom."
2081,79,40,10,I'm okay. Okay.
2082,79,40,3,I think they're funny.
2083,79,40,12,"Oh, yeah. Terribly funny. Really Witty. God, this place has gone to the dogs. Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes."
2084,79,40,1,"Shut up, Malfoy."
2085,79,40,12,D-Dementor! Dementor!
2086,79,40,3,Just ignore him.
2087,79,40,2,You're supposed to stroke it.
2088,79,40,10,Yeah.
2089,79,40,5,Isn't he beautiful? Say hello to Buckbeak.
2090,79,40,2,"Hagrid, exactly what is that?"
2091,79,40,5,"That, Ron, is a hippogriff. First thing you wanna know about hippogriffs is that they're very proud creatures. Very easily offended. You do not want to insult a hippogriff. It may just be the last thing you ever do. Now, who'd like to come and say hello? Well done, Harry. Well done. Come on now. Now... you have to let him make the first move. It's only polite. So... step up. Give him a nice bow. Then you wait and see if he bows back. If he does, you can go and touch him. If not... Well, we'll get to that later. Just make your bow. Nice and low. Back off, Harry. Back off. Keep still. Keep still. Well done, Harry. Well done. Here, you big brute, you. Right. I think you can go and pat him now. Go on. Don't be shy. Nice and slow, now. Nice and slow. Slow. Not so fast, Harry. Slow down, Harry. That's it... Nice and slow. Now let him come to you. Slowly, now, slowly, slowly... That's it... Yes! Well done! Well done, Harry, well done! I think he may let you ride him now."
2092,79,40,1,What?
2093,79,40,5,Come on.
2094,79,40,1,"Hey, hey, hey!"
2095,79,40,5,"Put you over here, just behind the wing joint. Don't pull out any of his feathers, because he won't thank you for that. Well done, Harry, and well done, Buckbeak."
2096,79,40,2,"That was wicked, Harry!"
2097,79,40,12,"Oh, please."
2098,79,40,5,"Well done, well done. How am I doing me first day?"
2099,79,40,1,"Brilliant, professor."
2100,79,40,12,"Yes you're not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute!"
2101,79,40,5,"Malfoy, no... No! Buckbeak! Whoa, whoa, whoa... Whoa! Buckbeak! Away, you silly creature!"
2102,79,40,12,It's killed me! It's killed me!
2103,79,40,5,Calm down! It's just a scratch!
2104,79,40,3,Hagrid! He has to be taken to the hospital.
2105,79,40,5,I'm the teacher. I'll do it.
2106,79,40,12,Oh You're gonna regret this.
2107,79,40,5,Class dismissed!
2108,79,40,12,You and your bloody chicken!
2109,80,36,91,"Does it hurt terribly, Draco?"
2110,80,36,12,"It comes and it goes. Still, I consider myself lucky. Madam Pomfrey said another minute and I could've lost my arm. I couldn't do homework for weeks."
2111,80,36,2,"Listen to the idiot. He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?"
2112,80,36,1,At least Hagrid didn't get fired.
2113,80,36,3,Yeah but I heard Draco's father's furious. We haven't heard the end of this.
2114,80,36,29,He's been sighted! He's been sighted!
2115,80,36,2,Who?
2116,80,36,29,Sirius Black!
2117,80,36,3,Dufftown? That's not far from here.
2118,80,36,126,"You don't think he'd come to Hogwarts, do you? With dementors at every entrance?"
2119,80,36,29,Dementors? He's already slipped past them once. Who's to say he won't do it again?
2120,80,36,126,That's right. Black could be anywhere. It's like trying to catch smoke. Like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands.
2121,80,30,11,"Intriguing, isn't it? Would anyone like to venture a guess... as to what is inside?"
2122,80,30,75,"That's a boggart, that is."
2123,80,30,11,"Very good, Mr. Thomas. Now, can anybody tell me what a boggart looks like?"
2124,80,30,3,No one knows.
2125,80,30,2,When did she get here?
2126,80,30,3,Boggarts are shape-shifters. They take the shape of whatever a particular person fears the most. That's what makes them so...
2127,80,30,11,"So terrifying, yes, yes, yes... Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart. Let's practice it now. Without wands, please. After me. Riddikulus!"
2128,80,30,136,Riddikulus!
2129,80,30,11,Very good. A little louder and very clear. Listen: Riddikulus!
2130,80,30,136,Riddikulus!
2131,80,30,12,This class is ridiculous.
2132,80,30,11,"Very good. So much for the easy part. You see, the incantation alone is not enough. What really finishes a boggart is laughter. You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing. Let me explain. Uh... Neville, would you join me, please? Come on, don't be shy. Come on. Come on. Hello. Neville, what frightens you most of all?"
2133,80,30,10,Professor Snape.
2134,80,30,11,Sorry?
2135,80,30,10,Professor Snape.
2136,80,30,11,"Professor Snape. Yes, frightens all. And I believe you live with your grandmother."
2137,80,30,10,"Y-Yes but I don't want that boggart to turn into her, either."
2138,80,30,11,"No... it won't. I want you to picture her clothes. Only her clothes, very clearly, in your mind."
2139,80,30,10,She carries a red handbag...
2140,80,30,11,"We don't need to hear. As long as you see it, we'll see it. Now, when I open that wardrobe... here's what I want you to do. Excuse me. Imagine Professor Snape in your grandmother's clothes. Can you do that? Yes. Wand at the ready. One, two, three. Think, Neville, think."
2141,80,30,10,Riddikulus!
2142,80,30,11,"Wonderful, Neville, wonderful! Incredible! Okay... to the back, Neville. Everyone, form a line! Form a line! I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most... and turn it into something funny. Next! Ron! Concentrate. Face your fear. Be brave! Wand at the ready, Ron, wand at the ready."
2143,80,30,2,Riddikulus!
2144,80,30,11,"Yes! You see? Very good, very good! Marvelous! Absolutely, very, very enjoyable! Parvati! Next! Show us what you see. Keep your nerve. Steady."
2145,80,30,78,Riddikulus!
2146,80,30,11,"And next! Step up, step up! Wonderful, wonderful! Here! Riddikulus! Right. Sorry about that. That's enough for today. Collect your books from the back. That's the end of the lesson. Thank you! Sorry! Sorry, you can have too much of a good thing."
2147,81,27,7,"Now remember, these visits to Hogsmeade village are a privilege. Should your behavior reflect poorly on the school in anyway that privilege shall not be extended again. No permission form signed, no visiting the village. That's the rule, Potter."
2148,81,27,35,"Those with permission, follow me. Those without, stay put."
2149,81,27,1,"But professor I thought if you signed it, then I could..."
2150,81,27,7,"I can't. Only a parent or a guardian can sign. Since I am neither, it would be inappropriate. I'm sorry, Potter. That's my final word."
2151,81,27,1,"Forget about it, guys. See you later."
2152,81,29,1,"Professor, can I ask you something?"
2153,81,29,11,"You want to know why I stopped you facing that boggart, yes? I would've thought it'd be obvious. I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort."
2154,81,29,1,I did think of Voldemort at first. But then I remembered that night on the train... and the dementor.
2155,81,29,11,I'm very impressed. That suggests what you fear the most is fear itself. This is very wise.
2156,81,29,1,Before I fainted... I heard something. A woman... screaming.
2157,81,29,11,Dementors force us to relive our very worst memories. Our pain becomes their power.
2158,81,29,1,I think it was my mother... the night she was murdered.
2159,81,29,11,"The very first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately. Not by your scar, by your eyes. They're your mother, Lily's. Yes. Oh, yes. I knew her. Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was. Not only was she a singularly gifted witch... she was also an uncommonly kind woman. She had a way of seeing the beauty in others... even, and perhaps most especially, when that person could not see it in themselves. And your father, James, on the other hand... he... He had a certain, shall we say, talent for trouble. A talent, rumor has it, he passed on to you. You're more like them than you know, Harry. In time, you'll come to see just how much."
2160,82,39,2,"Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant, but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop. We never did got a chance to go to the Shrieking Shack though. You heard it's the most..."
2161,82,39,1,The most haunted building in Britain. Yeah I know. What's going on?
2162,82,39,2,Probably Neville forgotten the password again.
2163,82,39,10,Hey!.
2164,82,39,2,"Oh, you're there."
2165,82,39,37,"Let me through, please. Excuse me! I'm Head Boy! Get back, all of you. No one is to enter this dormitory until it's been searched."
2166,82,39,20,The Fat Lady! She's gone!
2167,82,39,2,Serves her right. She was a terrible singer.
2168,82,39,3,"It's not funny, Ron."
2169,82,39,37,"Keep calm, everyone. Break into fours. Back to your common room. Be quiet."
2170,82,39,4,Make way.
2171,82,39,37,The headmaster's here.
2172,82,39,4,"Come on, move."
2173,82,39,37,You heard. Move!
2174,82,39,4,Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts. Tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady.
2175,82,39,35,"There's no need for ghosts, professor. The Fat Lady's there."
2176,82,39,37,Mind where you're going! Slow down! You listen! I'm Head Boy! Come back here!
2177,82,39,4,Keep moving!
2178,82,39,4,"Dear lady, who did this to you?"
2179,82,39,141,"Eyes like the devil, he's got, and a soul as dark as his name. It's him, headmaster. The one they all talk about. He's here, somewhere in the castle! Sirius Black!"
2180,82,39,4,"Secure the castle, Mr. Filch. The rest of you, to the Great Hall."
2181,82,36,35,"I've searched the Astronomy Tower and the Owlery, sir. But there's nothing there."
2182,82,36,4,"Ah, thank you."
2183,82,36,59,"The third floor's clear too, sir."
2184,82,36,4,Very good.
2185,82,36,6,"I've done the dungeons, headmaster. No sign of Black, nor anywhere else in the castle."
2186,82,36,4,I didn't really expect him to linger.
2187,82,36,6,"Remarkable feat, don't you think? To enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own... completely undetected?"
2188,82,36,4,"Quite remarkable, yes."
2189,82,36,6,Any theories on how he managed it?
2190,82,36,4,Many. Each as unlikely as the next.
2191,82,36,6,You may recall... prior to the start of term I expressed concerns... about your appointment of Professor...
2192,82,36,4,Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it. I'm quite convinced the castle is safe... and I'm more than willing to send the students back to their houses.
2193,82,36,6,What about Potter? Should he be warned?
2194,82,36,4,"Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep. For in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own. Let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud."
2195,83,30,6,Turn to page 394.
2196,83,30,1,"Excuse me, sir. Where's Professor Lupin?"
2197,83,30,6,"That's not really your concern, is it, Potter? Suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching... at the present time. Turn to page 394."
2198,83,30,2,Werewolves?
2199,83,30,3,"But sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks. We're not meant to start that for weeks."
2200,83,30,6,Quiet.
2201,83,30,2,When did she come in? Did you see her come in?
2202,83,30,6,"Now, which one of you can tell me the difference... between an Animagus and a werewolf? No one? How disappointing."
2203,83,30,3,"Please, sir. An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal. A werewolf has no choice. With each full moon, when he transforms, he no longer remembers who he is. He'd kill his best friend if he crossed his path. Furthermore, the werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind."
2204,83,30,6,"Thank you, Mr. Malfoy. That's the second time... you've spoken out of turn, Miss Granger. Are you incapable of restraining yourself... or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?"
2205,83,30,2,"He's got a point, you know."
2206,83,30,6,"Five points from Gryffindor. As an antidote to your ignorance, and on my desk, by Monday morning... two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with emphasis... on recognizing it."
2207,83,30,1,"Sir, it's Quidditch tomorrow."
2208,83,30,6,"Then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter. Loss of limb will not excuse you. Page 394. The term werewolf... is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word were... which means man, and wolf. Werewolf, man-wolf. There are several ways to become a werewolf. They include being given the power of shape-shifting... being bitten by a werewolf..."
2209,84,51,3,"Go, Harry! Go, Harry!"
2210,84,51,4,Arresto momentum!
2211,84,43,2,"He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?"
2212,84,43,14,Peaky? What do you expect? He fell over 100 feet.
2213,84,43,19,"Yeah, come on Ron, let's walk you off the astronomy tower and see what you look like."
2214,84,43,1,Probably a right sight better than he normally does.
2215,84,43,3,How are you feeling?
2216,84,43,1,"Oh, brilliant."
2217,84,43,14,"You gave us a right good scare there, mate."
2218,84,43,1,What happened?
2219,84,43,2,"Well, you fell off your broom."
2220,84,43,1,Really? I meant the match. Who won?
2221,84,43,3,"Umm... no one blames you, Harry. The dementors aren't supposed to come inside the grounds. Dumbledore's furious. As soon as he saved you, he sent them off."
2222,84,43,2,"There's something else you should know too. When you fell, your broom sort of blew into the Whomping Willow, and... Well..."
2223,84,37,11,I'm sorry to hear about your broomstick. Is there no chance of fixing it?
2224,84,37,1,"No. Professor, why do the dementors affect me so? I mean, more than everyone else?"
2225,84,37,11,"Listen. Dementors are amongst the foulest creatures to walk this earth. They feed on every good feeling, every happy memory... until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences. You are not weak, Harry. The dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past. Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine. You have nothing to be ashamed of."
2226,84,37,1,"I'm scared, professor."
2227,84,37,11,Well I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.
2228,84,37,1,I need to know how to fight them. You could teach me. You made that dementor on the train go away.
2229,84,37,11,There was only one that night.
2230,84,37,1,But you made it go away.
2231,84,37,11,"I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry. But as the dementors seem to have developed a particular interest in you... perhaps I should teach you. But after the holidays. For now, I need to rest."
2232,85,27,35,"Last call for Hogsmeade! Come on, now!"
2233,85,27,1,"Guys, let me go."
2234,85,27,14,"Clever, Harry."
2235,85,27,19,"But not clever enough. Besides, we've got a better way."
2236,85,27,1,I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
2237,85,27,14,We know. Don't worry. We'll get you there. We'll show you a quicker way. If you pipe down.
2238,85,27,19,We know. Don't worry. We'll get you there. We'll show you a quicker way. If you pipe down.
2239,85,27,14,Oh. Bless him.
2240,85,27,1,"Let me go! Come on, guys. Don't..."
2241,85,27,19,"Now, Harry."
2242,85,27,14,Come and join the big boys.
2243,85,27,19,Come and join the big boys.
2244,85,27,1,What are you doing?!
2245,85,27,1,What's this rubbish?
2246,85,27,14,What's this rubbish? he says. That there it's the secret to our success.
2247,85,27,19,It's a wrench giving it to you believe me. But we've decided your needs are greater than ours.
2248,85,27,14,"George, if you will."
2249,85,27,19,I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
2250,85,27,1,"Mr's. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs... are proud to present the Marauder's Map."
2251,85,27,19,We owe them so much.
2252,85,27,1,Hang on. This is Hogwarts. And that... No. Is that really...?
2253,85,27,14,Dumbledore.
2254,85,27,19,In his study.
2255,85,27,14,Pacing.
2256,85,27,19,Does that a lot.
2257,85,27,1,So you mean this map shows...
2258,85,27,14,Everyone.
2259,85,27,1,Everyone?
2260,85,27,19,Everyone.
2261,85,27,14,Where they are.
2262,85,27,19,What they're doing.
2263,85,27,14,Every minute.
2264,85,27,19,Of every day.
2265,85,27,1,Brilliant! Where did you get it?
2266,85,27,14,"Knicked it from Filch's office, of course. First year."
2267,85,27,19,"Now listen, there are seven secret passageways... out of the castle. We'd recommend"
2268,85,27,14,This one.
2269,85,27,19,This one.
2270,85,27,14,The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
2271,85,27,19,It'll lead you straight to Honeyduke's seller.
2272,85,27,14,You best hurry. Filch is heading this way.
2273,85,27,19,"Oh and Harry don't forget. When you're done, just give it a tap and say:"
2274,85,27,14,"Mischief managed. Otherwise, anyone can read it."
2275,85,27,19,"Mischief managed. Otherwise, anyone can read it."
2276,86,19,126,"Now, how much do you want? Delicious."
2277,86,19,3,It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain. Did I mention that?
2278,86,19,2,Twice.
2279,86,19,3,Do you want to move a bit closer?
2280,86,19,2,To the Shrieking Shack?
2281,86,19,2,"Actually, I'm fine here."
2282,86,19,12,"Well, well. Look who's here. You two shopping for your new dream home? Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee? Don't your family sleep in uh... one room?"
2283,86,19,2,"Shut your mouth, Malfoy."
2284,86,19,12,"Uh, Not very friendly. Boys, I think it's time we teach Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors."
2285,86,19,3,Hope you don't mean yourself!
2286,86,19,12,How dare you talk to me! You filthy little mudblood! Who is that? Don't stand there! Do something!
2287,86,19,80,What?
2288,86,19,2,"What's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis?"
2289,86,19,12,Get out of the way! Move!
2290,86,19,80,Malfoy! Wait! Wait!
2291,86,19,3,Harry!
2292,86,19,2,"Bloody hell, Harry. That was not funny."
2293,87,22,2,Those weasels! Never told me about any Marauder's Map.
2294,87,22,3,But Harry isn't going to keep it. He's going to turn it over to Professor McGonagall. Aren't you?
2295,87,22,2,Sure. Along with his Invisibility Cloak.
2296,87,22,3,"Oh, Look who it is. Madam Rosmerta. Ron fancies her."
2297,87,22,2,That's not true!
2298,87,22,17,Professor McGonagall!
2299,87,22,7,Cornelius!
2300,87,22,5,"Allow me, minister."
2301,87,22,17,"Oh, Hagrid..."
2302,87,22,5,Sorry about that.
2303,87,22,17,"Rosmerta, my dear. I hope business is good."
2304,87,22,66,It'd be a lot better if the Ministry wasn't sending dementors... into my pub every other night!
2305,87,22,17,We have... We have a killer on the loose!
2306,87,22,66,Sirius Black in Hogsmeade! And what would bring him here?
2307,87,22,17,Harry Potter.
2308,87,22,66,Harry Potter?
2309,87,22,17,Come.
2310,87,22,3,Harry!
2311,87,22,133,No underage wizards allowed in today! Shut the damn door!
2312,87,22,3,So rude.
2313,87,22,2,Thick heads.
2314,87,22,133,Thick heads?! How dare they! Who are they calling thick heads? Young whippersnappers!
2315,87,22,66,Nobody's going to come to a pub where they're gonna get scared out of their wits. Why?
2316,87,22,7,"Professor Dumbledore does not want dementors around the place, I can assure you."
2317,87,22,66,"Now, tell me what this is all about."
2318,87,22,7,"Well. Now years ago, when Harry Potter's parents realized they were marked for death... You remember? They went into hiding. Few knew where they were. One who did was Sirius Black. And he told You-Know-Who!"
2319,87,22,17,"Not only did Black lead You-Know-Who to the Potters that night, but he also killed one of their friends, Peter Pettigrew!"
2320,87,22,66,Peter Pettigrew?
2321,87,22,7,"Yes, little lump of a boy. Always trailing after Sirius Black."
2322,87,22,66,"Ah, I remember him. Never let James and Sirius out of his sight. But what happened?"
2323,87,22,7,"Well Peter Pettigrew tried to warn the Potters... and might have managed to, had he not run into an old friend, Sirius Black."
2324,87,22,17,Black was vicious. He didn't kill Pettigrew. He destroyed him! A finger. That's all that was left. A finger. Nothing else.
2325,87,22,7,"Yes. Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters, but he's the reason they're dead."
2326,87,22,17,And now he wants to finish what he started.
2327,87,22,7,Mhmm.
2328,87,22,66,I don't believe it.
2329,87,22,17,"Ah, that's not the worst of it."
2330,87,22,66,What could be worse?
2331,87,22,7,This: Sirius Black was... and remains to this day... Harry Potter's godfather!
2332,87,22,3,"Ron, look! Sorry, sorry. Excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Harry, what happened?"
2333,87,22,1,"He was their friend... and he betrayed them. He was their friend! I hope he finds me. Because when he does, I'm gonna be ready! When he does, I'm gonna kill him!"
2334,88,30,11,"Harry. There you are. You came. Are you sure about this, Harry? You know this is very advanced magic well beyond the Ordinary Wizarding Level."
2335,88,30,1,I'm sure.
2336,88,30,11,"Well, everything's prepared. Now, the spell I'm going to try to teach you is called the Patronus Charm. Did you ever hear of it? No? Well... A Patronus is a kind of positive force. For the wizard who conjures one... it works something like a shield, with the dementor feeding on it rather than him. But in order for it to work, you need to think of a memory. Not just any memory, a very happy memory, a very powerful memory."
2337,88,30,11,"Can you do this? Yes. Very well. Close your eyes. Concentrate. Explore your past. Do you have a memory? Allow it to fill you up. Lose yourself within it. Then speak the incantation, Expecto Patronum."
2338,88,30,1,Expecto Patronum.
2339,88,30,11,Very good. Shall we? Wand at the ready.
2340,88,30,1,Expecto Patronum! Expecto... Expecto... Expect...
2341,88,30,11,"Here we go. Come on. Sit up. Deep breaths. It's all right. I didn't expect you to do it the first time. That would have been remarkable. Here, eat this. You'll feel better."
2342,88,30,1,That's one nasty dementor.
2343,88,30,11,"Oh, no, no, no. That was a boggart, Harry. A boggart. The real thing would be worse. Much, much worse. As a matter of interest, what were you thinking? Which memory did you choose?"
2344,88,30,1,The first time I rode a broom.
2345,88,30,11,That's not good enough. Not nearly good enough.
2346,88,30,1,"There's another. It's not... happy, exactly. Well, it is. It's the happiest I've ever felt... but it's complicated."
2347,88,30,11,Is it strong? Then let's give it a try. You feel ready?
2348,88,30,1,Just do it. Expecto Patronum! Expecto Patronum!
2349,88,30,11,"Yes! Well done, Harry. Well done!"
2350,88,30,1,I think I've had enough for today.
2351,88,30,11,"Yes. Sit down. Here. Eat this, it helps. It really helps. And just so you know, Harry... I think you'd have given your father a run for his money. And that... is saying something."
2352,88,30,1,I was thinking of him. And Mom. Seeing their faces. They were talking to me. Just talking. That's the memory I chose. I don't even know if it's real. But it's the best I have.
2353,88,37,3,Beautiful day.
2354,88,37,2,Gorgeous.
2355,88,37,2,Unless of course you've been ripped to pieces!
2356,88,37,1,Ripped to pieces? What are you talking about?
2357,88,37,3,Ronald has lost his rat.
2358,88,37,2,I haven't lost anything! Your cat killed him!
2359,88,37,3,Rubbish.
2360,88,37,2,"Harry, you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers... is always lurking about. And Scabbers is gone."
2361,88,37,3,"Well, maybe you should take better care of your pets!"
2362,88,37,2,Your cat killed him!
2363,88,37,3,Did not.
2364,88,37,2,Did.
2365,88,37,3,Didn't.
2366,88,37,3,"How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing?"
2367,88,37,5,"Well, first off, the committee members took turns... talking about why we were there. And then I got up and did my piece. Said how Buckbeak... was a good hippogriff, always cleaned his feathers. And then Lucius Malfoy got up. Well, you can imagine. He said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature... who would kill you as soon as look at you."
2368,88,37,3,And then?
2369,88,37,5,"And then he asked for the worst, did old Lucius."
2370,88,37,1,They're not sacking you!
2371,88,37,5,"No, I'm not sacked. Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!"
2372,89,39,2,Spiders! There's... There's spiders. Spiders. They want me to tap-dance. I don't wanna tap-dance!
2373,89,39,1,You tell those spiders Ron.
2374,89,39,2,"Right, yeah. Tell them. I'll tell them..."
2375,89,28,66,Peter Pettigrew?
2376,89,28,7,Little lump of a boy. Always trailing after Sirius Black.
2377,89,28,17,"Black was vicious. He didn't kill Pettigrew, he destroyed him!"
2378,89,28,137,Put that light out!
2379,89,28,1,Sorry.
2380,89,28,137,"Watch it there, boy."
2381,89,28,137,We're trying to sleep here!
2382,89,28,137,"Yes, we are."
2383,89,28,1,Mischief managed. Nox.
2384,89,28,6,Potter. What are you doing wandering the corridors at night?
2385,89,28,1,I was sleepwalking.
2386,89,28,6,"How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter. He, too, was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle."
2387,89,28,1,"My dad didn't strut. And nor do I. Now, if you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you could lower your wand."
2388,89,28,6,Turn out your pockets. Turn out your pockets! What's this?
2389,89,28,1,Spare bit of parchment.
2390,89,28,6,Really? Open it. Reveal your secrets. Read it.
2391,89,28,1,"Mr's. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs... offer their compliments to Professor Snape and..."
2392,89,28,6,Go on.
2393,89,28,1,And request that he keep his abnormally large nose out of other people's business.
2394,89,28,6,"Why, you insolent little..."
2395,89,28,11,Professor!
2396,89,28,6,"Well, well. Lupin. Out for a little walk... in the moonlight, are we?"
2397,89,28,11,"Harry, are you alright?"
2398,89,28,6,"That remains to be seen. I have just now confiscated a rather curious artifact from Mr. Potter. Take a look, Lupin. Supposed to be your area of expertise. Clearly, it's full of dark magic."
2399,89,28,11,"Oh, I seriously doubt it, Severus. It looks as though it's merely a parchment designed to insult anyone... who tries to read it. I suspect it's a Zonko product. Nevertheless, I shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess. It is, after all, as you say, my area of expertise. Harry, would you come with me, please? Professor, good night."
2400,89,28,137,Are you deaf? Put that light out!
2401,89,30,11,"Come in. I haven't the faintest idea how this map came to be in your possession... but quite frankly, I am astounded that you didn't hand it in. Did it never occur to you that this, in the hands of Sirius Black... is a map to you?"
2402,89,30,1,"No. No, sir."
2403,89,30,11,"Your father never set much store by the rules either. But he and your mother gave their lives to save yours. Gambling their sacrifice by wandering around the castle unprotected... with a killer on the loose seems to me a poor way to repay them! Now, I will not cover up for you again, Harry. Do you hear me?"
2404,89,30,1,"Yes, sir."
2405,89,30,11,"I want you to return to your dormitory and stay there. And don't take any detours. If you do, I shall know."
2406,89,30,1,"Professor, just so you know, I don't think that map always works. Earlier, it showed someone in the castle. Someone I know to be dead."
2407,89,30,11,"Oh, really? And who might that be?"
2408,89,30,1,Peter Pettigrew.
2409,89,30,11,That's not possible.
2410,89,30,1,"It's just what I saw. Good night, professor."
2411,90,32,38,"Broaden your minds. You must look beyond. The art of crystal gazing is in the clearing of the Inner Eye. Only then can you see. Try again. Now, what do we have here?"
2412,90,32,3,"Oh, do you mind me trying? The Grim, possibly."
2413,90,32,38,"My dear, from the first moment you stepped foot in my class... I sensed that you did not possess the proper spirit... for the noble art of Divination. No, you see, there. You may be young in years, but the heart that beats beneath your bosom is as shriveled as an old maid's, your soul as dry as the pages of the books... to which you so desperately cleave. Have I said something?"
2414,90,32,2,"She's gone mental, Hermione has. I mean, not that she wasn't always mental... but now it's in the open for everyone to see."
2415,90,32,1,Hang on. We better take this back.
2416,90,32,2,I'm not going back.
2417,90,32,1,Fine. See you later.
2418,90,32,2,See you.
2419,90,32,18,Harry Potter...
2420,90,32,1,Professor Trelawney...
2421,90,32,38,He will return tonight.
2422,90,32,1,Sorry?
2423,90,32,38,"Tonight, he who betrayed his friends, whose heart rots with murder... shall break free. Innocent blood shall be spilt... and servant and master shall be reunited once more. I'm so sorry, dear boy. Did you say something?"
2424,90,32,1,No. Nothing.
2425,91,40,3,I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak. It's just too horrible.
2426,91,40,2,It just got worse.
2427,91,40,12,Now I'll tell you. Father said... I can keep the hippogriff's head. I think I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room. This is going to be rich. Look who's here. Come to see the show?
2428,91,40,3,"You! You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!"
2429,91,40,2,"Hermione, no! He's not worth it."
2430,91,40,80,"Malfoy, are you okay? Let's go. Quick."
2431,91,40,12,"Not a word to anyone, understood?"
2432,91,40,3,That felt good.
2433,91,40,2,"Not good, brilliant!"
2434,91,40,5,Look at him. Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them.
2435,91,40,1,Why don't we just set him free?
2436,91,40,5,"They'd know it was me, and then Dumbledore... would get into trouble. He's coming down, you know? Dumbledore. Says he wants to be with me when they... When it happens. Great man, Dumbledore. A great man."
2437,91,40,3,"We'll stay with you too, Hagrid."
2438,91,40,5,"You'll do no such thing! Think I want you seeing something like that? No. You just drink your tea and be off. Oh. Before you do, Ron..."
2439,91,40,2,Scabbers! You're alive!
2440,91,40,5,"Keep a closer eye on your pets, Ron."
2441,91,40,3,I think that means you owe someone an apology.
2442,91,40,2,"Right. Next time I see Crookshanks, I'll let him know."
2443,91,40,3,I meant me!
2444,91,40,5,Blimey! What was that?
2445,91,40,1,Ow! Hagrid!
2446,91,40,5,"Oh, crikey."
2447,91,40,17,Very interesting.
2448,91,40,4,"No, minister. Over this way."
2449,91,40,5,"It's late. It's nearly dark. You shouldn't be here. Someone sees you outside the castle at this time of night, you'll be in trouble. Big trouble. Particularly you, Harry. With you in a moment! Quick. Quick!"
2450,91,40,1,Hagrid. It'll be fine. It'll be okay.
2451,91,40,5,"Go on, go on!"
2452,91,40,4,"Yes, that's the... lings you see over there..."
2453,91,40,17,On the slope.
2454,91,40,4,"On the slope... Ah, Hagrid."
2455,91,40,5,Professor Dumbledore.
2456,91,40,17,Good evening.
2457,91,40,5,"Minister. Just make your way through. Have a tea, if you like."
2458,91,40,17,"No, Hagrid, thank you. Now gentlemen..."
2459,91,40,4,I'd like to have a cup of tea.
2460,91,40,17,"Well, I think we should get down to our business, shall we? Very well. It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff known as Buckbeak, hereinafter called the condemned, shall be executed this day at sundown."
2461,91,40,5,"Dear, dear..."
2462,91,40,4,"Now, now, Hagrid. Now, come on. All right. It'll be all right."
2463,91,40,17,The execution shall dispatch...
2464,91,40,1,What?
2465,91,40,3,I thought I just saw... Never mind.
2466,91,40,2,Let's go!
2467,91,40,5,Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.
2468,91,40,2,"Oh, no."
2469,92,40,2,He bit me! Scabbers!
2470,92,40,3,Ron. Ron! Ron!
2471,92,40,2,"Scabbers, come back!"
2472,92,67,1,Wait!
2473,92,67,2,"Scabbers, you bit me!"
2474,92,67,3,"Harry, you do realize what tree this is?"
2475,92,67,1,"That's not good. Ron, run!"
2476,92,67,2,"Harry, Hermione, run! It's the Grim! Harry!"
2477,92,67,3,"Ron! Ron, wait! Harry!"
2478,92,67,2,Help!
2479,92,67,1,Ron! Ron! Ron! Ron! Come on! Move!
2480,92,67,3,Duck!
2481,92,67,3,Harry!
2482,92,67,3,"Oh, I'm sorry."
2483,92,67,1,Don't worry.
2484,92,67,3,Where do you suppose this goes?
2485,92,67,1,I have a hunch. I just hope I'm wrong.
2486,92,20,3,"We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?"
2487,93,20,1,Come on. Ron.
2488,93,20,3,Ron. You're okay. The dog. Where is it?
2489,93,20,2,Harry it's a trap. He's the dog. He's an Animagus.
2490,93,20,3,"If you want to kill Harry, you'll have to kill us too!"
2491,93,20,18,No. Only one will die tonight.
2492,93,20,1,Then it'll be you!
2493,93,20,18,"Are you going to kill me, Harry?"
2494,93,20,11,"Expelliarmus! Well, well, Sirius. Looking rather ragged, aren't we? Finally, the flesh reflects the madness within."
2495,93,20,18,"Well, you'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you Remus? I found him."
2496,93,20,11,I know.
2497,93,20,18,It's him.
2498,93,20,11,I understand.
2499,93,20,18,Let's kill him!
2500,93,20,3,"No! I trusted you! And all this time, you've been his friend. He's a werewolf! That's why he's been missing classes."
2501,93,20,11,How long have you known?
2502,93,20,3,Since Professor Snape set the essay.
2503,93,20,11,"Well, well, well, Hermione. You really are the brightest witch of your age, I've ever met."
2504,93,20,18,"Enough talk, Remus! Come on, let's kill him!"
2505,93,20,11,Wait!
2506,93,20,18,I did my waiting! Twelve years of it! In Azkaban!
2507,93,20,11,Very well. Kill him. But wait one more minute. Harry has the right to know why.
2508,93,20,1,I know why. You betrayed my parents. You're the reason they're dead!
2509,93,20,11,"No, Harry it wasn't him. Somebody did betray your parents... but it was somebody who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead!"
2510,93,20,1,"Who was it, then?"
2511,94,20,18,"Peter Pettigrew! And he's in this room! Right now! Come out, come out, Peter! Come out, come out and play!"
2512,94,20,6,Expelliarmus! Vengeance is sweet. How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you.
2513,94,20,18,Severus...
2514,94,20,6,"I told Dumbledore you were helping an old friend into the castle, and now here's the proof."
2515,94,20,18,"Brilliant, Snape. Once again you've put your keen penetrating mind to the task and as usual come to the wrong conclusion. Now, if you'll excuse us, Remus and I have some unfinished business... to attend to."
2516,94,20,6,Give me a reason. I beg you!
2517,94,20,11,Severus don't be a fool.
2518,94,20,18,He can't help it. It's habit.
2519,94,20,11,Sirius be quiet.
2520,94,20,18,Be quiet yourself Remus!
2521,94,20,6,"Oh listen to you two, quarreling like an old married couple."
2522,94,20,18,Why don't you run along and play with your chemistry set!
2523,94,20,6,"I could do it, you know. But why deny the dementors? They're so longing to see you. Do I detect a flicker of fear? Oh, yes. A Dementor's Kiss. One can only imagine what that must be like. It's said to be nearly unbearable to witness, but I'll do my best."
2524,94,20,11,"Severus, please."
2525,94,20,6,After you.
2526,94,20,1,Expelliarmus!
2527,94,20,2,Harry! What did you just do?
2528,94,20,3,You attacked a teacher!
2529,94,20,1,Tell me about Peter.
2530,94,20,11,He was at school with us. We thought he was our friend!
2531,94,20,1,No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him!
2532,94,20,11,"No, he didn't. I thought so too, until you mentioned seeing Pettigrew on the map!"
2533,94,20,1,"The map was lying, then."
2534,94,20,18,The map never lies! Pettigrew's alive! And he's right there!
2535,94,20,2,Me?! He's mental!
2536,94,20,18,Not you! Your rat!
2537,94,20,2,Scabbers has been in my family for...
2538,94,20,18,"Twelve years? Curiously long life for a common garden rat! He's missing a toe, isn't he?"
2539,94,20,2,So what?
2540,94,20,1,All they could find of Pettigrew was his...
2541,94,20,18,Finger! That dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead! And then he transformed into a rat!
2542,94,20,1,"Show me. Give it to him, Ron."
2543,94,20,2,What are you trying to do to him? Scabbers! Leave him alone! Get off him! What are you doing?
2544,94,20,44,Remus? Sirius. My old friends! Harry! Look at you! You look so much like your father! Like James! We were the best of friends...
2545,94,20,18,How dare you speak to Harry! How dare you talk about James in front of him!
2546,94,20,11,"You sold James and Lily to Voldemort, didn't you?"
2547,94,20,44,"I didn't mean to! The Dark Lord. You have no idea the weapons he possesses! Ask yourself, Sirius! What would you have done? What would you have done?"
2548,94,20,18,"I would have died! I would have died, rather than betray my friends!"
2549,94,20,44,"Harry, James wouldn't have wanted me killed! Your dad... Your dad would have spared me! He would show me mercy!"
2550,94,20,11,"You should've realized, Peter, that if Voldemort didn't kill you, then we would! Together!"
2551,94,20,1,No!
2552,94,20,11,"Harry, this man..."
2553,94,20,1,I know what he is. But we'll take him to the castle.
2554,94,20,44,"Bless you, boy! Bless you!"
2555,94,20,1,"Get off! I said we'd take you to the castle. After that, the dementors can have you."
2556,95,67,18,Sorry about the bite. I reckon that twinges a bit.
2557,95,67,2,A bit? A bit? You almost tore my leg off!
2558,95,67,18,"I was going for the rat. Normally, I have a very sweet disposition as a dog. In fact, more than once, James suggested that I make the change permanent. The tail I could live with. But the fleas, they're murder."
2559,95,67,1,Okay.
2560,95,67,2,You better go.
2561,95,67,1,"No. Don't worry, okay? It's fine. I'll stay."
2562,95,67,3,"You go, I'll stay."
2563,95,67,1,You okay?
2564,95,67,2,I'm fine. Go.
2565,95,67,3,That looks really painful.
2566,95,67,2,So painful. They might chop it.
2567,95,67,3,I'm sure Madam Pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat.
2568,95,67,2,It's too late. It's ruined. It'll have to be chopped off.
2569,95,67,18,"It's beautiful, isn't it? I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors. It'll be nice to do it again as a free man. That was a noble thing you did back there. He doesn't deserve it."
2570,95,67,1,"Well I just didn't think my dad would have wanted his two best friends... to become killers. Besides, dead, the truth dies with him. Alive, you're free."
2571,95,67,44,"Turn me into a maggot! Turn me into a flobberworm! Anything but the dementors! Ron! Haven't I been a good friend? A good pet? You won't let them give me to the dementors, will you? I was your rat! Sweet girl! Clever girl! Surely you won't let them..."
2572,95,67,11,Get away from her!
2573,95,67,18,"I don't know if you know, Harry... but when you were born, James and Lily made me your godfather."
2574,95,67,1,I know.
2575,95,67,18,I can understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle... but if you ever wanted a different home...
2576,95,67,1,What? Come and live with you?
2577,95,67,18,It's just a thought. I can understand if you don't want to.
2578,95,67,3,Harry!
2579,95,67,18,"Remus, my old friend! Have you taken your potion tonight? You know the man you truly are, Remus! This heart is where you truly live! This heart here! This flesh is only flesh!"
2580,95,67,1,Expelliarmus!
2581,95,67,3,Harry!
2582,95,67,18,Remus! Remus! Run! Run!
2583,95,67,1,Come on.
2584,95,67,3,Wait! Wait!
2585,95,67,2,Hermione! Bad idea. Bad idea.
2586,95,67,3,Professor? Professor Lupin?
2587,95,67,2,Nice doggy. Nice doggy!
2588,95,67,6,"There you are, Potter!"
2589,95,67,1,Sirius!
2590,95,67,6,"Come back here, Potter!"
2591,96,37,1,Sirius! No. Sirius! Expecto Patronum!
2592,96,37,3,Harry?
2593,97,43,1,I saw my dad.
2594,97,43,3,What?
2595,97,43,1,He sent the dementors away. I saw him across the lake.
2596,97,43,3,"Listen Harry, they've captured Sirius. Any minute the dementors are going to perform the Kiss."
2597,97,43,1,You mean they're gonna kill him?
2598,97,43,3,"No. It's worse. Much worse. They're going to suck out his soul. Headmaster, you've got to stop them. They've got the wrong man."
2599,97,43,1,It's true. Sirius is innocent.
2600,97,43,2,It's Scabbers who did it.
2601,97,43,4,Scabbers?
2602,97,43,2,"He's my rat, sir. He's not really a rat. He was a rat. He was my brother Percy's rat. But then they gave him an owl..."
2603,97,43,3,"The point is, we know the truth. Please believe us."
2604,97,43,4,"I do, Miss Granger. But the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others. A child's voice, however honest and true... is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen. Mysterious thing, time. Powerful... and when meddled with, dangerous. Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower. You know the laws, Miss Granger. You must not be seen. And you would do well, I feel, to return before this last chime. If not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss. If you succeed tonight... more than one innocent life may be spared. Three turns should do it, I think. Oh, and by the way. When in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin. Good luck."
2605,97,43,2,What the bloody hell was that all about?
2606,97,43,3,"Sorry, Ron, but seeing as you can't walk..."
2607,98,43,1,What just happened? Where's Ron?
2608,98,43,3,7:30. Where were we at 7:30?
2609,98,43,1,I don't know. Going to Hagrid's?
2610,98,43,3,Come on. And we can't be seen.
2611,98,40,1,"Hermione! Hermione! Hermione, wait. Hermione, will you please tell me what it is we're doing?"
2612,98,40,3,"You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!"
2613,98,40,1,That's us.
2614,98,40,2,"Hermione, no! He's not worth it."
2615,98,40,1,This is not normal.
2616,98,40,3,"This is a Time-Turner, Harry. McGonagall gave it to me first term. This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year."
2617,98,40,1,You mean we've gone back in time?
2618,98,40,3,"Yes. Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment. Clearly, something happened he wants us to change."
2619,98,40,1,Good punch.
2620,98,40,3,Thanks. Malfoy's coming.
2621,98,40,80,Run.
2622,98,40,12,"Not a word to anyone, understood? I'm gonna get that jumped-up mudblood! Mark my words."
2623,98,40,3,That felt good.
2624,98,40,2,"Not good, brilliant."
2625,98,40,1,Come on. We should be at Hagrid's.
2626,99,40,1,Look. Buckbeak's still alive.
2627,99,40,3,"Of course. Remember what Dumbledore said? If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared. Let's go."
2628,99,40,1,Here they come. I'd better hurry.
2629,99,40,3,"Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him. Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free."
2630,99,40,2,"Scabbers, you're alive!"
2631,99,40,5,"Keep a closer eye on your pet, Ron."
2632,99,40,1,That's Pettigrew.
2633,99,40,3,"Harry, you can't."
2634,99,40,1,He betrayed my parents. You don't expect me to sit here.
2635,99,40,3,"Yes, and you must! Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now. If you just go bursting in, you'll think you've gone mad. Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time. We can't be seen."
2636,99,40,3,Fudge is coming. And we aren't leaving? Why aren't we leaving?
2637,99,40,1,Are you mad?
2638,99,40,1,Ow!
2639,99,40,1,Ow! That hurt!
2640,99,40,3,Sorry. We're coming out the back door. Go!
2641,99,40,3,Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?
2642,99,40,1,What?
2643,99,40,3,I thought I just saw... Never mind.
2644,99,40,2,Let's go.
2645,99,40,3,"Okay, go, Harry. Go!"
2646,99,40,1,Get away. Get off.
2647,99,40,4,"Minister, I really think I should sign as well."
2648,99,40,17,"Yes, very well. Perhaps it would be..."
2649,99,40,3,"Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly. Come with us now. Come on."
2650,99,40,3,Keep trying. Come on. Quickly. Buckbeak. Okay? Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?
2651,99,40,17,Your name only.
2652,99,40,4,It's such a very long name...
2653,99,40,3,"Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay? Come on. Come on, Buckbeak. Come and get the nice dead ferret. Come on. It's here. Come on, Beaky."
2654,99,40,4,"Here we are, minister. Follow me. Now, look there."
2655,99,40,17,Where?
2656,99,40,4,Look beyond the rocks.
2657,99,40,17,What am I supposed to see?
2658,99,40,4,Professor Dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster.
2659,99,40,17,"Oh, yes. Indeed, indeed."
2660,99,40,4,"And all the strawberries, you see?."
2661,99,40,3,"Come on, Buckbeak. Come on."
2662,99,40,17,I see no strawberries.
2663,99,40,4,Over there.
2664,99,40,17,Where?
2665,99,40,4,Over there.
2666,99,40,1,This way.
2667,99,40,17,"Let's get this over, please."
2668,99,40,4,All right.
2669,99,40,17,"But where is it? I saw the beast, just now. Not a moment ago!"
2670,99,40,4,How extraordinary.
2671,99,40,5,Buckbeak.
2672,99,40,17,"Come now, Dumbledore. Someone's obviously released him."
2673,99,40,17,Hagrid?
2674,99,40,3,Buckbeak.
2675,99,40,4,I don't think the minister's suggesting you had anything to do with this. How could you? You've been with us all the time.
2676,99,40,17,"Right. Well, well. We must search the grounds."
2677,99,40,4,"Well, search the skies, if you must, minister. Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy. Oh, executioner, your services are no longer required. Thank you."
2678,99,40,5,"You'll find no small glasses in this house, professor."
2679,99,40,1,"Come on. This way. This way, now. Now what?"
2680,99,67,3,We save Sirius.
2681,99,67,1,How?
2682,99,67,3,No idea. Look. It's Lupin.
2683,99,67,11,Immobulus!
2684,99,67,3,And Snape's coming.
2685,99,67,1,And now we wait.
2686,99,67,3,And now we wait.
2687,100,67,3,At least someone's enjoying himself.
2688,100,67,1,Yeah. Hermione?
2689,100,67,3,Yeah?
2690,100,67,1,"Before, down by the lake, when I was with Sirius... I did see someone. That someone made the dementors go away."
2691,100,67,3,With a Patronus. I heard Snape telling Dumbledore. According to him... only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it.
2692,100,67,1,It was my dad. My dad conjured the Patronus.
2693,100,67,3,"Harry, but your dad's... Dead. I know. I'm just telling you what I saw."
2694,100,67,3,Here we come.
2695,100,67,1,You see Sirius talking to me there? He's asking me to come live with him.
2696,100,67,3,That's great.
2697,100,67,1,"When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursleys'. It'll just be me and him. We could live in the country... someplace you can see the sky. I think he'll like that after all those years in Azkaban."
2698,100,67,3,Harry! Run!
2699,100,67,1,Let's go! What are you doing?
2700,100,67,3,Saving your life!
2701,100,67,1,Thanks. Great! Now he's coming for us.
2702,100,67,3,"Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run!"
2703,100,67,3,That was so scary.
2704,100,67,1,Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night. Sirius! Come on!
2705,100,37,3,This is horrible.
2706,100,37,1,Don't worry. My dad will come. He'll conjure the Patronus. Any minute now! Right there! You'll see!
2707,100,37,3,"Harry, listen to me. No one's coming."
2708,100,37,1,"Don't worry, he will! He will come! Sirius."
2709,100,37,3,You're dying... both of you. Harry!
2710,100,37,1,Expecto Patronum!
2711,100,37,1,"You were right, Hermione. It wasn't my dad I saw earlier. It was me! I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before. I knew I could do it this time because... well, I had already done it. Does that make sense?"
2712,100,37,3,No.
2713,100,37,3,But I don't like flying...!
2714,100,37,3,Bombarda!
2715,100,37,18,I'll be forever grateful for this... to both of you.
2716,100,37,1,I want to go with you.
2717,100,37,18,"One day, perhaps. For some time, my life will be too unpredictable. And besides... you're meant to be here."
2718,100,37,1,But you're innocent.
2719,100,37,18,"And you know it. And for now, that will do. I expect you're tired of hearing this... but you look so like your father. Except your eyes. You have..."
2720,100,37,1,My mother's eyes.
2721,100,37,18,"It's cruel that I spent so much time with James and Lily, and you so little. But know this: The ones that love us never really leave us. And you can always find them... in here. You really are the brightest witch of your age."
2722,100,37,3,We have to go.
2723,101,43,4,Well?
2724,101,43,1,He's free. We did it.
2725,101,43,4,Did what? Good night.
2726,101,43,2,How did you get there? I was talking to you there. And now you're there.
2727,101,43,3,"What's he talking about, Harry?"
2728,102,43,1,"I don't know. Honestly, Ron. How can somebody be in two places at once?"
2729,102,30,11,"Hello, Harry. I saw you coming. I've looked worse, believe me."
2730,102,30,1,You've been sacked.
2731,102,30,11,"No. No. I resigned, actually."
2732,102,30,1,Resigned? Why?
2733,102,30,11,"Well, it seems that somebody let slip the nature of my condition. This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving and parents will not want... well, someone like me teaching their children."
2734,102,30,1,But Dumbledore...
2735,102,30,11,"Dumbledore has already... risked enough on my behalf. Besides, people like me are... Well, let's just say that I'm used to it by now."
2736,102,30,11,"Why do you look so miserable, Harry?"
2737,102,30,1,None of it made any difference. Pettigrew escaped.
2738,102,30,11,"Didn't make any difference? Harry it made all the difference in the world. You have uncovered the truth. You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate. It made a great deal of difference. If I am proud of anything... it is of how much you have learned this year. Now, since I am no longer your teacher... I feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you. So now I'll say goodbye, Harry. I feel sure we'll meet again sometime. Until then... mischief managed."
2739,103,36,2,"Stand back, I said! Or I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle."
2740,103,36,10,Harry. Wherever did you get it?
2741,103,36,29,"Can I have a go, Harry? After you, of course."
2742,103,36,1,What are you talking about?
2743,103,36,2,"Quiet. Let the man through. I didn't mean to open it, Harry. It was badly wrapped. They made me do it."
2744,103,36,14,Did not.
2745,103,36,19,Did not.
2746,103,36,127,It's a Firebolt. It's the fastest broom in the world.
2747,103,36,1,For me? But who sent it?
2748,103,36,2,No one knows.
2749,103,36,3,This came with it.
2750,103,36,10,"Go on, Harry!"
2751,103,36,29,"Yeah, let's see."
2752,103,36,3,"How fast is it, Harry?"
2753,104,14,156,Bloody kids.
2754,104,14,44,Oh no no no my Lord Voldemort. I only meant... perhaps if we were to do it without the boy..
2755,104,14,9,"NO! The boy is everything, it cannot be done without him and it WILL be done exactly as I say."
2756,104,14,89,I will not disappoint you my lord.
2757,104,14,9,"Good. First, gather our old comrades. Send them a sign."
2758,104,14,9,Nagini tells me the old caretaker is standing outside the door.
2759,104,14,9,Step aside so I can give our guest a proper greeting.
2760,105,17,3,Harry!
2761,105,17,3,Are you alright?
2762,105,17,1,Hermione. Bad dream. When did you get here?
2763,105,17,3,Just now. You?
2764,105,17,1,Last night.
2765,105,17,3,Wake up. Wake up Ronald!
2766,105,17,2,Bloody hell.
2767,105,17,3,"Honestly. Get dressed, and don't go back to sleep. Come on Ron! Your mother says breakfast's ready."
2768,105,17,1,Where are we actually going?
2769,105,17,2,Don't know. Hey Dad! Where are we going?
2770,105,17,16,"Haven't the foggiest, keep up!"
2771,105,17,67,Arthur! It's about time son.
2772,105,17,16,"Sorry Amos. Some of us had a bit of a sleepy start. This is Amos Diggory everyone, he works with me at the ministry. And this strapping young lad must be Cedric, am I right?"
2773,105,17,36,Yes sir.
2774,105,17,67,"Merlin's beard, you must be Harry Potter."
2775,105,17,1,Yes sir. This way.
2776,105,17,67,Great great pleasure.
2777,105,17,1,Pleasure to meet you too sir.
2778,105,17,16,"That's it sir, just over there."
2779,105,17,67,Shall we? We don't want to be late.
2780,105,17,1,Why are they all standing around that manky old boot?
2781,105,17,14,That isn't just any old manky boot mate.
2782,105,17,19,It's a portkey.
2783,105,17,67,Time to go. Ready?
2784,105,17,1,What's a 'portkey'?
2785,105,17,67,After 3. One... Two...
2786,105,17,16,Harry!

2790,105,17,16,Let! Go!
2791,105,72,16,I bet that cleared your sinuses eh?
2792,105,72,1,Thanks.
2793,105,72,16,"Well kids, welcome to the Quidditch World Cup!"
2794,105,72,67,"Parting of the waves I think old chap, see you at the match."
2795,105,72,1,See ya later Cedric.
2796,105,72,16,Home sweet home.
2797,105,72,16,"Girls. Choose a bunk and unpack. Ron, get out of the kitchen we're all hungry."
2798,105,72,14,Yeah get out of the kitchen Ron.
2799,105,72,19,Yeah get out of the kitchen Ron.
2800,105,72,16,Feet off the table.
2801,105,72,14,Feet off the table.
2802,105,72,19,Feet off the table.
2803,105,72,1,I love magic.
2804,106,72,2,"Blimey Dad, how far up are we?"
2805,106,72,23,"Well put it this way, if it rains... you'll be the first to know"
2806,106,72,12,"Father and I are in the minister's box, by personal invitation of Cornelius Fudge himself."
2807,106,72,23,Don't boast Draco. There's no need with these people. Do enjoy yourself won't you. While you can.
2808,106,72,16,"Come on up, take your seats. I told you these seats would be worth waiting for."
2809,106,72,19,Come on!
2810,106,72,14,It's the Irish!
2811,106,72,19,Here come the Bulgarians!
2812,106,72,14,Krum!!!
2813,106,72,19,Krum!!!
2814,106,72,2,Krum!!!
2815,106,72,19,Yes!
2816,106,72,17,Good evening! It gives me great pleasure to welcome each and every one of you to the final of the 422nd Quidditch World Cup. Let the match begin!
2817,107,72,2,"There's no one like Krum. He's like a bird the way he rides the wind. He's more than an athlete, he's an artist."
2818,107,72,20,Think you're in love Ron?
2819,107,72,14,Viktor I love you! Viktor I do!
2820,107,72,19,Viktor I love you! Viktor I do!
2821,107,72,14,When we're apart my heart beats only for youuu!
2822,107,72,19,When we're apart my heart beats only for youuu!
2823,107,72,1,When we're apart my heart beats only for youuu!
2824,107,72,14,Sounds like the irish have got their pride on.
2825,107,72,16,Stop! Stop it. It's not the irish. We've gotta get out of here. Now.
2826,107,72,16,"Get back to the portkey everybody, and stick together. Fred, George... Ginny is your responsibility."
2827,107,72,2,Been looking for you for ages. Thought we lost you.
2828,107,72,1,What is that?
2829,107,72,16,Stop! That's my son.
2830,107,72,16,"Ron, Harry, Hermione are you alright?"
2831,107,72,33,Which of you conjured this?
2832,107,72,16,You can't possibly..
2833,107,72,33,Do not lie! You have been discovered at the scene of the crime!
2834,107,72,1,Crime?
2835,107,72,16,"Barty, they're just kids."
2836,107,72,1,What crime?
2837,107,72,3,Harry it's his mark.
2838,107,72,1,"Those people tonight, in the masks... they're his too aren't they? they're his followers."
2839,107,72,33,Follow me.
2840,107,72,1,There was a man. Before. There.
2841,107,72,33,"All of you, this way."
2842,107,72,16,"Harry, who?"
2843,107,72,1,I dunno. I didn't see his face.
2844,107,42,146,Anything from the trolley? Anything from the trolley?
2845,107,42,146,Anything from the trolley dears?
2846,107,42,2,Packet of drewbals and a liquorice wand.
2847,107,42,2,"On second thought, just the drewbals."
2848,107,42,1,It's alright I'll get it.
2849,107,42,2,"Just the drewbals, thanks."
2850,107,42,55,Two pumpkin pasties please.
2851,107,42,55,Thank you.
2852,107,42,146,Anything sweet for you dear?
2853,107,42,1,Oh no thank you I'm not hungry.
2854,107,42,3,"This is horrible, how can the ministry not know who conjured it. Isn't there any security or?"
2855,107,42,2,"Loads according to Dad, that's what worried them so much. Happened right under their noses."
2856,107,42,3,"It's hurting again isn't it, your scar."
2857,107,42,1,I'm fine.
2858,107,42,3,"You know Sirius will want to hear about this. What you saw at the world cup, and the dream."
2859,108,36,5,Clear the runway.
2860,108,36,1,Well there's something you don't see every day.
2861,108,36,4,"Now we're all settled in and sorted, I'd like to make an announcement. This castle will not only be your home this year but home to some very special guests as well. You see Hogwarts has been choosen..."
2862,108,36,4,"So Hogwarts has been choosen to host a legendary event. The Tri-Wizard tournament. Now for those of you who do not know, the tri-wizard tournament brings together three schools for a series of magical contests. From each school a single contestant is selected to compete. Now let me be clear, if choosen you stand alone. And trust me when I say these contests are not for the faint hearted, but more of that later. For now please join me in welcoming the lovely ladies of the Beauxbatons Academy of magic and their headmistress Madam Maxime."
2863,108,36,131,"Blimey, that's one big woman."
2864,108,36,4,"And now our friends from the north, please greet the proud sons of Durmstrang and the high master Igor Karkaroff."
2865,108,36,2,"Blimey it's him, Viktor Krum!"
2866,108,36,49,Albus!
2867,108,36,4,Igor.
2868,108,36,69,"Professor Dumbledore, my horses have travelled a long way. They will need attending to."
2869,108,36,4,"Not to worry Madame Maxime, our gamekeeper Hagrid's more than capable of seeing to them."
2870,108,36,69,"But you know Monsieur Hagrid, they drink only single malt whiskey."
2871,108,36,59,You idiot!
2872,108,36,4,"Your attention please! I would like to say a few words. Eternal glory, that is what awaits the student who wins the tri-wizard tournament. But to do this that student must survive three tasks. Three extremely dangerous tasks."
2873,108,36,14,Wicked.
2874,108,36,4,For this reason the ministry has seen fit to impose a new rule. To explain all this we have the head of the department of international magic cooperation Mister Bartimus Crouch.
2875,108,36,2,"Bloody hell, it's Mad-Eye Moody."
2876,108,36,3,Alastor Moody? The aura.
2877,108,36,2,He was a catcher. Half the cells in Azkaban are full thanks to him. He's supposed to be mad as a hatter though these days.
2878,108,36,4,"My dear old friend, thanks for coming."
2879,108,36,13,That stupid roof.
2880,108,36,29,What's that he's drinking do you suppose?
2881,108,36,1,I don't know but I don't think it's Pumpkin Juice.
2882,108,36,33,After much deliberation the ministry has concluded that for their own safety no student under the age of seventeen shall be allowed to put forth their name for the tri-wizard tournament. This decision is final.
2883,108,36,19,That's rubbish! You don't know what you're doing!
2884,108,36,4,Silence!
2885,108,36,4,"The goblet of fire. Anyone wishing to submit themselves for the tournament merely write their name upon a piece of parchment and throw it in the flame before this hour on Thursday night. Do not do so lightly, if choosen there's no turning back. As from this moment the tri-wizard tournament has begun."
2886,109,30,13,Alastor Moody.
2887,109,30,13,"Ministry malcontent. And your new defence against the dark arts teacher. I'm here because Dumbledore asked me, end of story, goodbye, the end. Any questions? When it comes to the dark arts, I believe in a practical approach. But first, which of you can tell me how many unforgivable curses there are?"
2888,109,30,3,Three sir.
2889,109,30,13,And they are so named?
2890,109,30,3,Because they are unforgivable. Use of any one of them will...
2891,109,30,13,"Will earn you a one way ticket to Azkaban. Correct. Now the ministry says you're too young to see what these curses do. I say different! You need to know what you're up against, you need to be prepared, you need to find somewhere else to put your chewing gum other than the underside of your desk Mr Finnigan!"
2892,109,30,29,"Aw no way, the old codger can see out the back of his head."
2893,109,30,13,"So, which curse shall we see first?"
2894,109,30,2,Yes...
2895,109,30,13,Give us a curse.
2896,109,30,2,"Well, my dad did tell me about one... The imperious curse."
2897,109,30,13,"Ahhh yes, your father would know all about that. Gave the ministry quite a bit of grief a few years ago. Perhaps this will show you why."
2898,109,30,13,Hello. What a little beauty.
2899,109,30,13,Don't worry. Completely harmless.
2900,109,30,13,But if she bites... she's lethal!
2901,109,30,13,What are you laughing at?
2902,109,30,13,Talented isn't she? What shall I have her do next? Jump out the window? Drown herself?
2903,109,30,13,"Scores of witches and wizards have claimed that they only do did you-know-whose bidding under the influence of the imperious curse. But here's the rub, how do we sort out the liars? Another.. another.. Come on come on. Longbottom is it? Up."
2904,109,30,13,Professor Sprout tells me you have an aptitude for herbology.
2905,109,30,10,There's the um... The cruciatus curse.
2906,109,30,13,Correct! Correct! come come. Particularly nasty. The torture curse.
2907,109,30,3,"Stop it! Can't you see it's bothering him, stop it!"
2908,109,30,13,Perhaps you could give us the last unforgivable curse Miss Granger.
2909,109,30,13,The killing curse. Only one person is known to have survived it. And he's sitting in this room.
2910,109,30,2,"Brilliant isn't he! Completely demented of course. Terrifying to be in the same room with, he's really BEEN there you know."
2911,109,30,3,"There's a reason those curses are unforgivable, and to perform them in a classroom. I mean did you see Neville's face."
2912,109,30,3,Neville?
2913,109,30,13,Son. You alright?
2914,109,30,13,"Come on, we'll have a cup of tea. I want to show you something."
2915,109,36,2,"Eternal glory, be brilliant wouldn't it? In three years from now we'll be old enough to be choosen."
2916,109,36,1,Yeah well rather you than me.
2917,109,36,19,"Thank you thank you, well lads we've done it."
2918,109,36,14,Cooked it up just this morning.
2919,109,36,3,It's not going to work.
2920,109,36,14,Oh yeah? And why's that Granger.
2921,109,36,3,You see this? This is an age line. Dumbledore drew it himself.
2922,109,36,14,So?
2923,109,36,3,So a genius like Dumbledore couldn't possibly be fooled by something pathetically dimwitted such as an age potion.
2924,109,36,19,That's why it's so brilliant.
2925,109,36,19,Ready Fred?
2926,109,36,14,Ready George?
2927,109,36,19,You said..
2928,110,36,4,"Sit down please. And now the moment you've all been waiting for, the champions selection!"
2929,110,36,4,The Durmstrang champion is ... Viktor Krum!
2930,110,36,4,The champion from Beauxbatons... Fleur Delacour
2931,110,36,4,The Hogwarts champion... Cedric Diggory.
2932,110,36,4,"Excellent! we now have our three champions! But in the end only one will go down in history. Only one will hoist this chalice of champions, this vessel of victory the tri-wizard cup!"
2933,110,36,4,Harry Potter. Harry Potter?
2934,110,36,5,No... No.
2935,110,36,4,Harry Potter!
2936,110,36,3,Go on Harry. Harry for goodness sake.
2937,110,36,131,He's a cheat! He's not even seventeen yet.
2938,110,63,4,Harry! Did you put your name in the goblet of fire?
2939,110,63,1,No sir.
2940,110,63,4,Did you ask one of the older students to do it for you?
2941,110,63,1,No sir.
2942,110,63,4,You're absolutely sure?
2943,110,63,1,Yes sir.
2944,110,63,69,Well of course he is lying.
2945,110,63,13,"The hell he is. The goblet of fire is an exceptionally powerful magical object, only an exceptionally powerful conjurer could have hoodwinked it. Magic way beyond the talents of a fourth year."
2946,110,63,49,You seem to have given this a fair bit of thought Mad-Eye.
2947,110,63,13,It was once my job to think as dark wizards do Karkaroff perhaps you remember?
2948,110,63,4,That doesn't help Alastor. Leave this to you Barty.
2949,110,63,33,"The rules are absolute, the goblet of fire constitutes a binding magical contract. Mr Potter has no choice, he is as of tonight... a tri-wizards champion."
2950,111,41,7,"This can't go on Albus. First the dark mark, now this?"
2951,111,41,4,What do you suggest Minerva?
2952,111,41,7,Put an end to it. Don't let Potter compete.
2953,111,41,4,You heard Barty the rules are clear.
2954,111,41,7,Well the devil with Barty and his rules. And since when did you accomodate them...
2955,111,41,6,"Master I too find it difficult to believe this mere coincidence, if we are to truly discover the meaning of these events perhaps we should for the time being let them unfold."
2956,111,41,7,Do nothing?? Offer him up as bait? Potter is a boy not a piece of meat.
2957,111,41,4,"I agree with Severus. Alastor, keep an eye on Harry will you?"
2958,111,41,13,I can do that.
2959,111,41,4,"Don't let him know though, he must be anxious enough as it is... knowing what lies ahead. Then again, we all are."
2960,111,39,2,How did you do it?
2961,111,39,2,Never mind. Doesn't matter. You could have let your best friend know though.
2962,111,39,1,Let you know what?
2963,111,39,2,You know bloody well what.
2964,111,39,1,I didn't ask for this to happen Ron. Okay? You're being stupid.
2965,111,39,2,"Yeah that's me, Ron Weasley... Harry Potter's stupid friend."
2966,111,39,1,"I didn't put my name in that cup. I don't want eternal glory I just wanna be.. Look, I don't know what happened tonight and I don't know why, it just did ok."
2967,111,39,2,Piss off.
2968,112,63,57,What a charismatic quartet. Hello!
2969,112,63,57,"I'm Rita Skeeter, I write for the daily prophet. But of course you know that don't you. It's you we don't know, you're the news. What quirks lurk beneath those rosy cheeks? what mysteries do the muscles mask? does courage lie beneath those curls? In short, what makes a champion tick. Me, myself and I want to know. Not to mention my rabid readers. So, who's feeling up to sharing? Mmm? Shall we start with the youngest. Lovely."
2970,112,63,57,This is cosy.
2971,112,63,1,It's a broomcupboard.
2972,112,63,57,You should feel right at home then. Don't mind if I use the quill do you?
2973,112,63,1,"Oh, no."
2974,112,63,57,"So Harry, here you sit, a mere boy of twelve.."
2975,112,63,1,I'm fourteen.
2976,112,63,57,...about to compete against three students. Not only vastly more emotionally mature than yourself but have mastered spells that you wouldn't attempt in your dizziest daydreams. Concerned?
2977,112,63,1,I dunno I haven't really thought about it.
2978,112,63,57,Course you're not just any ordinary boy of twelve are you...
2979,112,63,1,Fourteen.
2980,112,63,57,The story's legend. Do you think it was the trauma of your past that made you so keen to enter such a dangerous tournament.
2981,112,63,1,No I didn't enter.
2982,112,63,57,"Course you didn't. Everyone loves a rebel Harry.  Scratch that last. Speaking of your parents, were they alive, how do you think they'd feel? proud? or concerned that your attitude shows at best a pathological need for attention, at worst a psychotic deathwish."
2983,112,63,1,"Hey, my eyes aren't glistening with the ghosts of my past."
2984,113,39,18,Harry. I couldn't risk sending Edward. It was since the world cup and the ministry's been intercepting more and more owls and she's too easily recognised. We need to talk Harry. Face to face. Meet me in the Griffindore common room at one o clock this Saturday night and make sure you're alone. P.S....
2985,113,39,18,The bird bites.
2986,113,39,1,Sirius?
2987,113,39,57,"Harry Potter aged 12, suspect entrant in the tri-wizard tournament. His eyes swimming with the ghosts of his..."
2988,113,39,1,Sirius?! How...
2989,113,39,18,I don't have much time Harry so let me get straight to it. Did you or did you not put your name into the goblet of fire?
2990,113,39,1,No!
2991,113,39,18,"Shh... I had to ask. Now, tell me about this dream of yours. You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort, but who was the third man in the room?"
2992,113,39,1,I dunno.
2993,113,39,18,You didn't hear a name?
2994,113,39,1,No. Umm.. Voldemort was giving him a job to do. Something important.
2995,113,39,18,What was that?
2996,113,39,1,"He wanted... me. I dunno why, but he was gonna use this man to get to me. I mean it was only a dream right?"
2997,113,39,18,"Yes. It's just a dream. Look Harry, the deatheaters at the world cup, your name rising from that goblet these are not just coincidences. Hogwarts isn't safe any more."
2998,113,39,1,What are you saying?
2999,113,39,18,"I'm saying the devils are inside the walls. Igor Karkaroff, he was a deatheater. And no one, no one stops being a deatheater. Then there's Barty Crouch, heart of stone, sent his OWN son to Azkaban."
3000,113,39,1,Do you think one of them put my name in the goblet?
3001,113,39,18,I haven't a clue who put your name in that goblet Harry but whoever did it is no friend to you. People die in this tournament.
3002,113,39,1,I'm not ready for this Sirius.
3003,113,39,18,You don't have a choice.
3004,113,39,1,Someone's coming!
3005,113,39,18,Keep your friends close Harry.
3006,113,39,2,Who you talking to?
3007,113,39,1,Who says I was talking to anyone.
3008,113,39,2,I heard voices.
3009,113,39,1,"Maybe you're imagining things, wouldn't be the first time."
3010,113,39,2,You're probably just practicing for your next interview I expect.
3011,114,37,10,Amazing. Amazing.
3012,114,37,1,Neville! You're doing it again!
3013,114,37,10,"Oh, right sorry."
3014,114,37,1,Magical water plants of the highland Lochs?
3015,114,37,10,Moody gave it to me. That day we had tea.
3016,114,37,3,We've already been through enough people why don't you just go and do it yourself? Ughh. What do you want me to say again?
3017,114,37,3,Ronald would like me to tell you that Seamus told him that Dean was told by Parvati that Hagrid was looking for you.
3018,114,37,1,Is that right? Well.... what?
3019,114,37,3,Uhhh...
3020,114,37,3,Dean was told by Parvati that... Please don't ask me say it again. Hagrid's looking for you.
3021,114,37,1,Well you can tell Ronald...
3022,114,37,3,I'm NOT an owl!
3023,114,35,5,Did you bring your father's cloak like I asked you?
3024,114,35,1,Yeah I brought the cloak. Hagrid where are we going?
3025,114,35,5,You'll see soon enough. Pay attention this is important.
3026,114,35,1,What's with the flower? Hagrid have you combed your hair?
3027,114,35,5,As a matter of fact I have. You might like to try the same thing now and again.
3028,114,35,69,Hagrid?
3029,114,35,5,"Oh, the cloak. Put the cloak on."
3030,114,35,5,Bonsoir Olympe.
3031,114,35,69,"Oh Hagrid. I thought you weren't coming, I thought perhaps... you had... forgotten me."
3032,114,35,5,Couldn't forget you Olympe.
3033,114,35,69,What is it you want to show me? When we spoke earlier you sounded so exhilirated.
3034,114,35,5,You'll be glad you came. Trust me.
3035,114,35,69,"Ahh, c'est magnifique!"
3036,114,35,69,Can we get closer?
3037,114,35,1,Dragons? That's the first task? You're joking.
3038,114,35,5,Come on Harry. They're seriously misunderstood creatures.
3039,114,35,5,"Although, I have to admit that horntail is a right nasty piece of work. Poor Ron nearly fainted just seeing him you know."
3040,114,35,1,Ron was here?
3041,114,35,5,Oh sure. His brother Charlie helped bring him over from Romania. Didn't Ron tell you that?
3042,114,35,1,No he didn't. He didn't tell me a thing.
3043,115,45,131,Cedric rules!
3044,115,45,1,Thanks.
3045,115,45,131,Like the badge?
3046,115,45,1,Excuse me..
3047,115,45,1,Can I have a word?
3048,115,45,36,Alright.
3049,115,45,1,Dragons. That's the first task. They've got one for each of us.
3050,115,45,36,"Are you serious? And Fleur and Krum, do they...?"
3051,115,45,1,Yes.
3052,115,45,36,"Right. Hey listen, about the badges. I've asked them not to wear them."
3053,115,45,1,Don't worry about it.
3054,115,45,1,You're a right foul git you know that?
3055,115,45,2,You think so?
3056,115,45,1,I know so.
3057,115,45,2,Anything else?
3058,115,45,1,Yeah. Stay away from me.
3059,115,45,2,Fine.
3060,115,45,12,Why so tense Potter? My father and I have a bet you see. I don't think you're gonna last ten minutes in this tournament. He disagrees. He thinks you won't last
3061,115,45,1,"I don't give a damn what you or your father thinks Malfoy. He's vile and cruel, and you're just pathetic."
3062,115,45,13,I'll teach you to cast when someone's back is turned.
3063,115,45,7,Professor Moody what are you doing?
3064,115,45,13,Teaching.
3065,115,45,7,Is that a student?
3066,115,45,13,Technically it's a ferret.
3067,115,45,12,My father will hear about this!
3068,115,45,13,Is that a threat!
3069,115,45,13,I could tell you stories about your father that would curl even your greasy hair boy! It doesn't end here!
3070,115,45,7,"We never use transfigration as a punishment, surely Dumbledore told you that."
3071,115,45,13,He might've mentioned it.
3072,115,45,7,Well you will do well to remember it.
3073,115,45,13,come with me.
3074,115,30,13,That's a foal glass. Lets me keep an eye on my enemies. If I can see the whites of their eyes they're standing right behind me.
3075,115,30,13,Wouldn't even bother telling you what's in ther. You wouldn't believe it if I did. Now... what are you going to do about your dragon?
3076,115,30,1,Oh... um... You know I just thought I'd...
3077,115,30,13,"Sit. Listen to me Potter. Your pal Diggory, by your age he could take a whistle into a watch and have it sing you the time. Miss Delacour, she's as much a fairy princess as I am. As for Krum, his head may be filled with sawdust but Karkaroff's is NOT. They'll have a strategy, and you can bet that it'll play to Krum's strengths. Hmm? Come on Potter. What are your strengths?"
3078,115,30,1,Um... I dunno.. I can fly. I mean I'm a fair flyer.
3079,115,30,13,Better than fair the way I heard it.
3080,115,30,1,But I'm not allowed a broom.
3081,115,30,13,You're allowed a wand.
3082,116,51,3,Pssst! Harry? Is that you?
3083,116,51,1,Yeah.
3084,116,51,3,How are you feeling? OK? The key is to concentrate. After that you just have to...
3085,116,51,1,Battle a dragon.
3086,116,51,57,Young love! Ohh how.. stirring. If everything goes unfortunately today you might make the front page.
3087,116,51,114,You have no business here. This tent is for champions and friends.
3088,116,51,57,No matter. We've got what we wanted.
3089,116,51,4,"Good day champions. Gather round please. Now you've waited, you've wondered and at last the moment has arrived. The moment only four of you can fully appreciate."
3090,116,51,4,What are you doing here Miss Granger?
3091,116,51,3,Oh um.. Sorry I'll just go.
3092,116,51,4,Barty. The bag.
3093,116,51,33,"Champions, in a circle around me. Miss Delacour over here, Mr Krum, and Potter over here. Right. Miss Delacour, if you will..."
3094,116,51,33,The welsh green. Mr Krum...
3095,116,51,33,The chinese fireball. Oooooh.
3096,116,51,33,The swedish short-snout. Which leaves...
3097,116,51,1,The horntail...
3098,116,51,33,What's that boy?
3099,116,51,1,Nothing.
3100,116,51,33,"The hungarian horntail. These represent very real dragons, each of which has been given a golden egg to protect. Your objective is simple, collect the egg. This you must do, for each egg contains a clue without which you cannot hope to proceed to the next task. Any questions?"
3101,116,51,4,Very well. Good luck champions. Mr Diggory the sound of the cannon...
3102,116,51,4,Three of our champions have now faced their dragons and so each one of them will proceed to the next task. And now our fourth and final contestant.
3103,116,51,3,Your wand harry! Your wand!
3104,116,39,19,We knew you wouldn't die Harry.
3105,116,39,14,Lose a leg.
3106,116,39,19,Or an arm.
3107,116,39,14,Pack it in altogether.
3108,116,39,29,"Go on Harry, what's the clue?"
3109,116,39,1,Who wants me to open it? You want me to open it?
3110,116,39,1,What the bloody hell was that?
3111,116,39,14,"Alright everyone, go back to your knitting. This is gonna be uncomfortable enough without all you nosey sods listening in."
3112,116,39,2,I reckon you'd have to be barking mad to put your own name in the goblet of fire.
3113,116,39,1,Caught on have you. Took you long enough.
3114,116,39,2,Wasn't just me who thought you'd done it. Everyone was saying it behind your back.
3115,116,39,1,Brilliant. That makes me feel loads better.
3116,116,39,2,At least I warned you about the dragons.
3117,116,39,1,Hagrid warned me about the dragons.
3118,116,39,2,"Oh no no, I did. Don't you remember? I told Hermione to tell you that Seamus told me that Parvati told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you. Seamus never actually told me anything, so it was really me all along. I thought you'd be alright, you know, after you figured that out."
3119,116,39,1,Who could possibly figure that out? That's completely mental.
3120,116,39,2,Yeah it is isn't it. Suppose I was a bit distraught.
3121,116,39,3,Boys.
3122,116,36,3,Look at this! I can't believe it she's done it again. Miss Granger a plain but ambitious girl seems to be developing a taste for famous wizards. Her latest prey sources report is none other than the Bulgarian bon-bon Viktor Krum. No word yet on how Harry Potter's taking this latest emotional blow.
3123,116,36,111,Parcel for you Mr Weasley.
3124,116,36,2,Thank you Nigel.
3125,116,36,2,Not now Nigel. Later. Go on.
3126,116,36,2,I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph. Oh look mum's sent me something. Mum sent me a dress??
3127,116,36,1,Well it does match your eyes. Is there a bonnet?
3128,116,36,2,Ginny these must be for you.
3129,116,36,20,I'm not wearing that it's ghastly.
3130,116,36,2,What are you on about?
3131,116,36,3,They're not for Ginny they're for you! Dress robes.
3132,116,36,2,Dress robes? for what?
3133,117,61,7,"The yule ball has been a tradition of the tri-wizard tournament since its inception. On Christmas eve night we and our guests gather in the great hall for well mannered frivolity. As representitives of the host school I expect each and every one of you to put your best foot forward, and I mean this literally because the yule ball is first and foremost... a dance."
3134,117,61,7,"Silence. The house of Godrick Griffindore has commanded the respect of the wizard world for nearly ten centuries. I will not have you in the course of a single evening besmirching that name by behaving like a babbling, bumbling band of baboons."
3135,117,61,14,Try saying that five times faster.
3136,117,61,7,"Now to dance is to let the body breathe, inside every girl a secret swan slumbers longing to burst forth and take flight."
3137,117,61,2,Something's about to burst out of Hilary but I don't think it's a swan.
3138,117,61,7,"Inside every boy a lordly lion prepared to prance. Mr Weasly, will you join me."
3139,117,61,7,"Now, place your right hand on my waist."
3140,117,61,2,Where?
3141,117,61,7,My waist.
3142,117,61,7,Now bend your arm. Mr Filch...
3143,117,61,7,"One two three, one two three, one two three."
3144,117,61,1,Oi! Never gonna let him forget this are you?
3145,117,61,14,Never.
3146,117,61,19,Never.
3147,117,61,7,Everybody come together.
3148,117,61,7,"Boys, on your feet."
3149,118,36,1,Why do they always have to travel in packs? How are you supposed to get one alone to ask them...
3150,118,36,2,"Blimey Harry, you slayed dragons. If you can't get a date who can?"
3151,118,36,1,I think I'd take the dragon right now.
3152,118,36,5,"I take after my mum. Though I didn't know her very well, she left when I was about three. No, not the maternal sort her, broke my dad's heart though. You know he was a tiny little fellow my dad, I could pick him up with one hand by the age of six and put him up in the dresser."
3153,118,36,5,"And then he died when I was still in school. So I had to make me own way as it were. But enough of me, what about you!"
3154,118,36,2,This is mad. At this rate we'll be the only ones in our year without dates.
3155,118,36,2,"Well, us and Neville!"
3156,118,36,1,But then again he can take himself.
3157,118,36,3,It might interest you to know that Neville's already got someone.
3158,118,36,2,Now I'm really depressed.
3159,118,36,2,"Well Hermione, you're a girl."
3160,118,36,3,Oh well spotted.
3161,118,36,2,Come on. It's one thing for a bloke to show up alone. For a girl it's just sad.
3162,118,36,3,I won't be going alone because believe it or not someone's asked me. And I said yes.
3163,118,36,2,Bloody hell.
3164,118,36,2,"Look. We've just got to grit our teeth and do it. Tonight when we get back to the common room, we'll both have partners. Agreed?"
3165,118,36,1,Agreed.
3166,118,47,55,Harry!
3167,118,47,1,Cho!
3168,118,47,55,"Watch yourself on the stairs, it's a bit icey at the top."
3169,118,47,1,Ok thanks. Cho?
3170,118,47,55,Yes?
3171,118,47,1,Um.  I just wondered if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me?
3172,118,47,55,Sorry? I didn't catch that.
3173,118,47,1,Um. I was just wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me.
3174,118,47,55,Oh. Um. Harry I'm sorry but someone's already asked me. And well I've said I'll go with him.
3175,118,47,1,Ok. Great. Fine. No problem. Good.
3176,118,47,55,Harry I really am sorry.
3177,118,39,1,What happened to you?
3178,118,39,131,He just asked Fleur Delacour out.
3179,118,39,3,What?
3180,118,39,1,What did she say?
3181,118,39,3,No of course.
3182,118,39,3,She said yes??
3183,118,39,1,Don't be silly.
3184,118,39,2,"There she was walking by. You know I like it when they walk. I couldn't help it, it just sort of slipped out."
3185,118,39,131,"Actually he sort of screamed at her, it was a bit frightening."
3186,118,39,1,What did you do then?
3187,118,39,2,What else? I ran for it. I'm not cut out for this Harry. I don't know what got into me.
3188,118,39,78,Hi Harry.
3189,118,39,101,Hi Harry.
3190,118,39,1,Hey!
3191,119,36,2,Bloody hell.
3192,119,36,2,What are those??
3193,119,36,1,My dress robes.
3194,119,36,2,"Well they're alright. No lace, no dodgy little collar."
3195,119,36,1,Well I expect yours are more traditional.
3196,119,36,2,Traditional?? They're ancient! I look like my great aunt Tessie.
3197,119,36,2,I smell like my great aunt Tessie. Murder me Harry.
3198,119,36,1,Leave it alone.
3199,119,36,2,"Poor kid, bet she's alone in her room crying her eyes out."
3200,119,36,1,Who?
3201,119,36,2,"Hermione of course. Come on Harry, why'd you think she wouldn't tell us who she's coming with?"
3202,119,36,1,Because we'd take the mickey out of her if she did.
3203,119,36,2,Because nobody asked her. I would have taken her myself if she weren't so bleeding proud.
3204,119,36,78,Hello boys. Don't you look...
3205,119,36,78,... dashing.
3206,119,36,7,Here you are Potter. Are you and Miss Patil ready?
3207,119,36,1,Ready professor?
3208,119,36,7,To dance. It's traditional that the three champions or in this case four are the first to dance. Surely I told you that.
3209,119,36,1,No.
3210,119,36,7,"Oh well now you know. Oh, as for your Mr Weasly you may proceed into the great hall with Miss Patil."
3211,119,36,78,She looks beautiful.
3212,119,36,1,Yeah she does.
3213,119,36,101,Is that Hermione Granger? With Viktor Krum??
3214,119,36,2,No. Absolutely not.
3215,119,36,78,Harry. Take my waist.
3216,119,36,1,What?
3217,119,36,78,Now.
3218,119,36,3,Hot isn't it? Viktor's gone to get drinks. Care to join us?
3219,119,36,2,"No, we'd NOT care to join you and Viktor."
3220,119,36,3,What's got your wand in a knot?
3221,119,36,2,He's a Durmstrang. You're fraternising with the enemy.
3222,119,36,3,"The enemy?? Who was it wanting his autograph? Besides, the whole point of the tournament is international magical cooperation, to make friends."
3223,119,36,2,"Hrmph, I think he's got a bit more than friendship on his mind."
3224,119,36,101,Are you going to ask me to dance or not?
3225,119,36,2,No.
3226,119,36,2,He's using you.
3227,119,36,3,How dare you! Besides I can take care of myself.
3228,119,36,2,Doubt it. He's way too old.
3229,119,36,3,What? What? That's what you think?
3230,119,36,2,Yeah that is what I think.
3231,119,36,3,You know the solution then don't you.
3232,119,36,2,Go on.
3233,119,36,3,"Next time there's a ball pluck up the courage and ask me before somebody else does, and not as a last resort."
3234,119,36,2,Well that's completely off the point. Harry...
3235,119,36,3,Where have you been? Nevermind! Off to bed both of you.
3236,119,36,2,They get scary when they get older.
3237,119,36,3,Ron you spoil everything!
3238,119,39,9,Let me see it again.
3239,119,39,9,"Ah yes, the time is close now. Harry! At last! Step aside Wormtail so I can give our guest a proper greeting!"
3240,119,39,10,You alright Harry? I just got in. Me!
3241,120,29,3,Harry you told me you'd figured the egg out weeks ago. The task is two days from now.
3242,120,29,1,Really? I had no idea. I suppose Viktor's already figured it out.
3243,120,29,3,"I wouldn't know, we didn't actually talk about the tournament. Actually we didn't really talk at all, Viktor's more of a physical being. I just mean he's not particularly... Mostly he watches me study. It's a bit annoying actually. You are trying to figure this egg out aren't you?"
3244,120,29,1,What's that supposed to mean?
3245,120,29,3,"I mean these tasks are supposed to test you, in the most brutal way they're almost cruel. And um, I'm scared for you. You got by the dragon mostly on nerve, I'm not sure it's going to be enough this time."
3246,120,29,36,Hey Potter.
3247,120,29,1,Cedric.
3248,120,29,36,How are you?
3249,120,29,1,Spectacular.
3250,120,29,36,Look I realise I never really thanked you properly for tipping me off about those dragons.
3251,120,29,1,Forget about it. I'm sure you would have done the same for me.
3252,120,29,36,Exactly. You know the prefects bathroom on the fifth floor?
3253,120,29,36,It's not a bad place for a bath. Just take your egg and mull things over in the hot water.
3254,120,50,1,I must be out of my mind.
3255,120,50,39,I'd try putting it in the water if I were you.
3256,120,50,1,Myrtle!
3257,120,50,39,Long time no see.
3258,120,50,39,I was circling a blocked drain the other day and could swear I saw a bit of polyjuice potion. Not being a bad boy again are you Harry?
3259,120,50,1,"Polyjuice potion! Kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say try putting it in the water?"
3260,120,50,39,"Well. That's what he did. The other boy, the handsome one. Cedric."
3261,120,50,39,"Well go on, open it."
3262,120,50,151,"Come seek us where our voices sound. We cannot sing above the ground. An hour long you'll have to look, to recover what we took."
3263,120,50,1,"Myrtle, there aren't Merpeople in the black lake are there?"
3264,120,50,39,"Ahhh, very good. Took Cedric ages to riddle it out. Almost all the bubbles were gone..."
3265,120,44,3,"Harry, tell me again."
3266,120,44,1,Come seek us where our voices sound.
3267,120,44,3,"The black lake, that's obvious."
3268,120,44,1,An hour long you'll have to look.
3269,120,44,3,"Again obvious, though I must admit potentially problematic"
3270,120,44,1,Potentially problematic? When was the last time you held your breath under the water for an hour Hermione?
3271,120,44,3,"Look Harry, we can do this. The three of us can figure it out."
3272,120,44,13,"Hate to break up this scholar session but Professor McGonagall would like to see you in her office. Not you Potter, just Weasly and Granger."
3273,120,44,3,"But sir, the second task is only hours away and..."
3274,120,44,13,Exactly. Presumably Potter is well prepared by now and could do with a good night's sleep. Go. Now! Longbottom!
3275,120,44,13,Why don't you help Potter put his books back.
3276,120,44,10,"You know, if you're interested in plants you'd be better with Gorshok's Guide to Herbology. Do you know there's a wizard in Nepal whose growing gravity resistant trees?"
3277,120,44,1,"Neville. No offense, but I really don't care about plants. Now if there's a Tibetan turnip that will allow me to breathe underwater for an hour then great."
3278,120,44,10,I don't know about a turnip but you can always use gilliweed.
3279,121,37,1,You're sure about this Neville.
3280,121,37,10,Absolutely.
3281,121,37,1,For an hour.
3282,121,37,10,Most likely.
3283,121,37,1,Most likely?
3284,121,37,10,Well there is some debate among herbologists as to the effects of freshwater versus saltwater.
3285,121,37,1,You're telling me this now? You must be joking.
3286,121,37,10,I just wanted to help.
3287,121,37,1,Well that makes you sight better than Ron and Hermione. Where are they anyway?
3288,121,37,10,You seem a little tense Harry.
3289,121,37,1,Do I?
3290,121,37,4,"Welcome to the second task. Last night something was stolen from each of our champions. A treasure of sorts. These four treasures, one for each champion, now lie on the bottom of the black lake. In order to win each champion need only find their treasure and return to the surface. Simple enough. Except for this, they will have one hour to do so and one hour only. After that they'll be on their own."
3291,121,37,13,Put that in your mouth.
3292,121,37,4,You may begin at the start of the cannon.
3293,121,37,29,What's the matter with him?
3294,121,37,75,I don't know I can't see him.
3295,121,37,10,Oh my god I've killed Harry Potter!
3296,121,37,4,The Beauxbatons champion Miss Delacour has unfortunately been forced to retire. She will take no further part in this task.
3297,121,37,1,But she's my friend too!
3298,121,37,151,Only one.
3299,121,37,4,Harry!
3300,121,37,33,Get him another towel.
3301,121,37,4,I want all the judges over here now.
3302,121,37,81,"You saved her, even though she wasn't yours to save. My little sister!"
3303,121,37,81,Thank you! And you... . You helped!
3304,121,37,2,Well... yeah... a bit
3305,121,37,2,Merci.
3306,121,37,3,Harry!
3307,121,37,1,Hermione
3308,121,37,3,Are you alright? You must be freezing! Personally I think you behaved admirably.
3309,121,37,1,I finished last Hermione.
3310,121,37,3,Next to last.
3311,121,37,4,Attention! Attention! The winner is... Mr Diggory!
3312,121,37,4,"For showing unique command of the bubblehead shark. The way I see it, Mr Potter would have finished first had it not been for his determination to rescue not only Mr Weasly but the others as well. We've agreed to award him second place! For outstanding moral fibre."
3313,121,37,14,All that moral fibre eh?
3314,121,37,2,Blimey even when you go wrong it turns out right.
3315,121,37,19,Well done 'moral fibre'.
3316,122,37,33,"Congratulations Potter, fine achievement. Well done boy. I'm sorry we haven't spoken, after all your story is one I've heard many times. Quite remarkable. Tragic of course, to lose one's family. Never whole again are we? Still, life goes on. And here we stand. I'm sure your parents would be very proud today Potter."
3317,122,37,13,Bartimus! Not trying to lure Potter into one of the ministry's summer internships are we? Last boy who went into the department of ministries never came out!
3318,122,37,13,And they say I'm mad.
3319,122,37,5,"So I remember, I remember when I first met you all. Biggest bunch of misfits I've ever set eyes on. Always reminded me of myself a little. And here we all are, four years later."
3320,122,37,2,We're still misfits.
3321,122,37,5,"Maybe. But we've all got each other, and Harry of course. Soon to be! The youngest! Tri-Wizard champion there's ever been! Hooray!"
3322,122,37,1,Mr Crouch?
3323,123,41,4,"A man has died here. And he won't be the last, you must take action."
3324,123,41,17,I will not. In times like these the wizard world looks to its leaders for strength Dumbledore.
3325,123,41,4,Then for once show them some.
3326,123,41,17,The tri-wizard tournament will not be cancelled. I will not be seen as a coward.
3327,123,41,4,"But surely that is what's right, no matter what others think."
3328,123,41,17,What did you say? What did you say to me?
3329,123,41,13,"Excuse me gentlemen, it may interest you to know that this conversation is no longer private."
3330,123,41,17,Harry! Harry how good to see you again.
3331,123,41,1,I can come back later Professor.
3332,123,41,4,"Oh not necessary Harry the minister and I are done. I'll be back in a moment. Minister, after you. Harry do feel free to indulge in a liquorice snack in my absence, but I have to warn you they're a little bit sharp."
3333,123,48,1,Agh!
3334,123,48,1,Professor?
3335,123,48,33,"Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought from Azkaban at your own request to present evidence to this counsel. Should your testimony prove consequential. Counsel may be prepared to order your immediate release. Until such time you remain in the eyes of the ministry a convicted deatheater. Do you accept these terms?"
3336,123,48,49,I do sir.
3337,123,48,33,What do you wish to present?
3338,123,48,49,"I have names sir. There was a Rosier, Evan Rosier."
3339,123,48,33,Mr Rosier is dead.
3340,123,48,49,Dead?
3341,123,48,13,Yeah took a piece of me with him though didn't he.
3342,123,48,49,I didn't know.
3343,123,48,33,If that is all the witness has to offer...
3344,123,48,49,"No! No! There was Rookwood, he was a spy."
3345,123,48,33,Augustus Rookwood? Of the department of ministries.
3346,123,48,49,"Ya ya, the same. He passed information to you know who from inside the ministry itself."
3347,123,48,33,Very well. Counsel will deliberate. In the meantime you will be returned to Azkaban.
3348,123,48,49,"NO! WAIT! PLEASE! I have more. Snape, Severus Snape."
3349,123,48,4,The counsel is very much aware you have given evidence on this matter. Severus Snape was indeed a deatheater and prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall turned spy for us at great personal risk. Today he's no more a deatheater than I am.
3350,123,48,49,It's a lie! Severus Snape remains faithful to the dark lord.
3351,123,48,33,Silence!
3352,123,48,33,Unless the witness possesses any name of genuine consequence this session is now concluded.
3353,123,48,49,Oh no no no no no. I heard about one more.
3354,123,48,33,What's that?
3355,123,48,49,The name...
3356,123,48,33,Yes?
3357,123,48,49,"I know for a fact this person took part in the capture, and by means of the cruciatus curse, torture of the aurer Frank Longbottom and..."
3358,123,48,33,The name! Give me the wretched name!
3359,123,48,49,Barty Crouch! ... Junior.
3360,123,48,89,Get your hands off me you pathetic little men. Hello father.
3361,123,48,33,You are no son of mine.
3362,124,41,4,"Curiosity's not a sin Harry, but you should exercise caution. It's a pensieve, useful if like me you find your mind a wee bit stretched. It allows me to see what small things I've already seen. You see Harry I've searched and searched for something, some small detail. Something I might have overlooked, something that would explain why these terrible things have happened. Every time I get close to an answer it slips away, it's maddedning."
3363,124,41,1,"Sir, Mr Crouch's son, what happened to him?"
3364,124,41,4,"He was sent to Azkaban. Destroyed Barty to do it. But he had no choice, the evidence was overwhelming. Why do you ask?"
3365,124,41,1,"It's just that I had a dream about him. It was in the summer, before school. In the dream I was in a house and Voldemort was there only he wasn't quite human, and Wormtail was there too and Mr Crouch's son."
3366,124,41,4,Have there been other dreams like this?
3367,124,41,1,"Yes. Always the same one. Sir... these dreams, what I see, you don't think it's actually happening do you?"
3368,124,41,4,"I think it's unwise for you to linger over these dreams Harry, I think it's best that you simply..."
3369,124,41,4,Cast them away.
3370,124,28,49,"It's a sign Severus, you know what it means as well as I."
3371,124,28,6,"Potter! What's your hurry? Congratulations, your performance in the black lake was inspiring. Gilliweed, am I correct?"
3372,124,28,1,Yes sir.
3373,124,28,6,"Ingenious. A rather rare herb gilliweed, not something found in your every day garden. Nor is this, know what it is?"
3374,124,28,1,Bubble juice sir?
3375,124,28,6,"Veritaserum. Three drops of this and you-know-who himself will spill his darkest secrets. The use of this on a student is regrettably forbidden, however should you ever steal from my personal stores again, my hand might just slip over your morning pumpkin juice."
3376,124,28,1,I haven't stolen anything.
3377,124,28,6,"Don't lie to me. Gilliweed might be innocuous, but boomslang skin? lacewing flies? You and your friends are brewing polyjuice potion and believe me I'm going to find out why."
3378,125,62,4,Earlier today Professor Moody placed the tri-wizards cup deep within the maze. Only he knows its exact position. Now as Mr Diggory...
3379,125,62,4,and Mr Potter tied for first position they will be the first to enter the maze. Followed by Mr Krum...
3380,125,62,4,"The first person to touch the cup will be the winner. I've instructed the staff to patrol the perimeter, if at any point should a contestant wish to withdraw from the task he or she need only send up red sparks with their wands. Contestants, gather round."
3381,125,62,4,"In the maze you'll find not dragons or creatures of the deep. Instead you'll face something more challenging. You see, people change in the maze. Oh find the cup if you can, but be very weary you could just lose yourselves along the way."
3382,125,62,13,Champions! Prepare yourselves.
3383,125,62,4,On the count of three... ONE...
3384,125,62,1,Fleur? Fleur!
3385,125,62,36,Get down!
3386,125,62,1,No stop! He's bewitched Cedric.
3387,125,62,36,Get off me!
3388,125,62,1,He's bewitched!
3389,125,62,36,Harry! Harry!
3390,125,62,36,You know for a moment there I thought you were gonna let it get me.
3391,125,62,1,For a moment so did I.
3392,125,62,36,Some game huh?
3393,125,62,1,Some game.
3394,125,62,36,"Go. Take it, you saved me!"
3395,125,62,1,"Together, on three. One, two, three!"
3396,126,14,36,You ok?
3397,126,14,1,"Yeah, you?"
3398,126,14,36,Where are we?
3399,126,14,1,I've been here before.
3400,126,14,36,It's a portkey. Harry the cup is a portkey.
3401,126,14,1,"I've been here before in a dream. Cedric, we have to get back to the cup? Now!"
3402,126,14,36,What are you talking about?
3403,126,14,36,What is it?
3404,126,14,1,Get back to the cup!
3405,126,14,36,Who are you? What do you want?
3406,126,14,9,Kill the spare.
3407,126,14,1,Cedric!
3408,126,14,9,"Do it, now!"
3409,126,14,44,"Bones of the father, unwillingly given."
3410,126,14,44,Flesh of the servent willingly sacrificed.
3411,126,14,44,Blood of the enemy forcibly taken.
3412,126,14,44,The dark lord shall rise again.
3413,126,14,9,My wand Wormtail.
3414,126,14,9,Hold out your arm.
3415,126,14,44,Master. Thank you master.
3416,126,14,9,The other arm Wormtail.
3417,127,14,9,"Welcome my friends. Thirty years it's been, and yet you stand before me as though it were only yesterday. I confess myself disappointed, not one of you tried to find me."
3418,127,14,9,"Not even you, Lucius."
3419,127,14,23,My lord. Had I detected any sign or even a whisper of your whereabouts.
3420,127,14,9,"There were signs my friend, and more than whispers."
3421,127,14,23,"I assure you I never renounced the old ways. The face I have been obliged to present each day since your absence, that was my true mask."
3422,127,14,44,I returned.
3423,127,14,9,"Out of fear, not loyalty. Still you have proved yourself useful these past few months Wormtail."
3424,127,14,44,"Thank you master, thank you."
3425,127,14,9,"Oh, such a handsome boy."
3426,127,14,1,Don't touch him.
3427,127,14,9,"Harry! I'd almost forgotten you were here. Standing on the bones of my father. I'd introduce you but word has it you're almost as famous as me these days. The boy who lived. How lies have fed your legend Harry. Shall I reveal what really happened that night thirteen years ago? Shall I divulge how I truly lost my powers? It was love. You see when dear sweet Lily Potter gave her life for her only son she provided the ultimate protection. I could not touch you. It was old magic, something I should have forseen. But no matter, no matter. Things have changed, I can touch you now!"
3428,127,14,9,"Astonishing what a few drops of your blood will do eh Harry? Pick up your wand Potter. I said pick it up, get up. Get up! You've been taught how to duel I presume yes? First we bow to each other. Come on now Harry the niceties must be observed, Dumbledore would not want you to forget your manners now would he? I said bow!"
3429,127,14,9,That's better. And now...
3430,127,14,9,"Atta boy Harry, your parents would be proud. Especially your filthy mongrel mother. I'm going to kill you Harry Potter, I'm going to destroy you. After tonight no one will ever again question my powers. After tonight if they speak of you they'll speak only of how you begged for death, and I being a merciful lord obliged. Get up."
3431,127,14,9,"Don't you turn your back on me Harry Potter I want you to look at me when I kill you, I want to see the lights leave your eyes."
3432,127,14,1,Have it your way.
3433,127,14,9,Do nothing. He is mine to finish. He's mine!
3434,128,14,42,"Harry when the connection is broken you must get to the portkey. We can delay it for a moment to give you time but only a moment, do you understand?"
3435,128,14,36,Harry take my body back will you? Take my body back to my father.
3436,128,14,45,Let go. Sweetheart you're ready. Let go! Let go!
3437,128,14,9,No!
3438,128,62,4,Harry! Harry!
3439,128,62,4,Tell me what happened!
3440,128,62,1,"He's back, he's back! Voldemort's back. Cedric, he asked me to bring his body back. I couldn't leave him, not there."
3441,128,62,4,"It's alright Harry. It's alright, he's home, you both are."
3442,128,62,17,"Keep everybody in their seats. A boy has just been killed. The body must be moved Dumbledore, there are... too many people."
3443,128,62,67,Let me through! That's my son! My boy!
3444,129,30,13,Are you alright Potter?
3445,129,30,13,Does it hurt?
3446,129,30,1,Not so much now.
3447,129,30,13,I'd better take a look at it.
3448,129,30,1,The cup was a portkey. Someone had bewitched it.
3449,129,30,13,What was it like? What was he like?
3450,129,30,1,Who?
3451,129,30,13,The dark lord. What was it like to stand in his presence?
3452,129,30,1,I dunno. It was like I'd fallen into one of my dreams. One of my nightmares.
3453,129,30,13,"Were there others? In the graveyard, were there others?"
3454,129,30,1,Um. I don't think I said anything about a graveyard Professor.
3455,129,30,13,Marvellous creatures dragons aren't they? Do you think that miserable oaf would have led you into the woods if I hadn't suggested it? Do you think Cedric Diggory would have told you to hold the egg under the water if I hadn't have told him first myself? Do you think Neville Longbottom the witless wonder could have provided you with gilliweed if I hadn't have given him the book that led you straight to it? Huh??
3456,129,30,1,It was you from the beginning. You put my name in the goblet of fire. You bewitched Krum. But...
3457,129,30,13,You won because I made it so Potter. You ended up in that graveyard tonight because it was meant to be so. And now the deed is done. The blood that runs through these veins runs within the dark lord. Imagine how he will reward me when he learns that I have once and for all silenced the great Harry Potter.
3458,129,30,4,Severus...
3459,129,30,4,Do you know who I am?
3460,129,30,13,Albus Dumbledore.
3461,129,30,4,Are you Alastor Moody? Are ya?
3462,129,30,13,No.
3463,129,30,4,Is he in this room? Is he in this room?
3464,129,30,4,Harry get away from there!
3465,129,30,4,Are you alright Alastor?
3466,129,30,13,I'm sorry Albus.
3467,129,30,1,"That's Moody, but then who's...?"
3468,129,30,6,Polyjuice potion.
3469,129,30,4,Now we know who's been stealing it from your store Severus.
3470,129,30,4,We'll get you up in a minute.
3471,129,30,4,Barty Crouch Junior.
3472,129,30,89,I'll show you mine if you show me yours.
3473,129,30,4,Your arm Harry.
3474,129,30,89,You know what this means don't you? He's back. Lord Voldemort has returned.
3475,129,30,4,"Send an owl to Azkaban, think they'll find they're missing a prisoner."
3476,129,30,89,I'll be welcomed back like a hero.
3477,129,30,4,Perhaps. Personally I've never had much time for heroes.
3478,130,36,4,"Today we acknowledge a really terrible loss. Cedric Diggory was as you all know, exceptionally hard working, intricately fair minded. And most importantly a fierce fierce friend. I think therefore you have the right to know exactly how he died. You see, Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord Voldemort. The ministry of magic does not wish me to tell you this. But not to do so I think would be an insult to his memory. Now the pain we all feel at this dreadful loss reminds me, reminds us that while we may come from different places and speak in different tongues, our hearts beat as one. In light of recent events the bonds of friendship we made this year will be more important than ever. Remember that and Cedric Diggory will not have died in vain, you remember that. And we'll celebrate a boy who was kind and honest and brave and true right to the very end."
3479,130,39,4,"I never liked these curtains. Set them on fire in my fourth year, by accident of course. I put you in terrible danger this year Harry I'm sorry."
3480,130,39,1,"Professor, when I was in the graveyard there was a moment... um... when Voldemort's wand and mine sort of connected."
3481,130,39,4,Priori Incantatem. You saw your parents that night didn't you? They reappeared.
3482,130,39,4,"No spell can reawaken the dead Harry I trust you know that. Dark and diffiult times lie ahead. Soon we must all face the choice between what is right what is easy. But remember this, you have friends here. You're not alone."
3483,130,58,114,Write to me. Promise.
3484,130,58,3,Bye.
3485,130,58,81,Au revoir Ron.
3486,130,58,2,Do you think we'll ever just have a quiet year at Hogwarts?
3487,130,58,3,No.
3488,130,58,1,No I don't think so.
3489,130,58,3,Everything's going to change now isn't it?
3490,130,58,1,Yes.
3491,130,58,3,Promise you'll write this summer. Both of you.
3492,130,58,2,Well I won't. You know I won't!
3493,130,58,3,Harry will won't you?
3494,131,11,31,"Oh, it's you."
3495,131,11,148,"What should we do with him, Big D?"
3496,131,11,1,"Big D? Cool name, but to me, you'll always be Ikkle Duddicums."
3497,131,11,31,Shut up!
3498,131,11,31,"Ooo, tough guy. Not so tough in your bed, are you?"
3499,131,11,1,What?
3500,131,11,88,"You boys go home now, or I'll be calling your parents!"
3501,131,11,31,"I heard you talking in your sleep, last night. Crying. ""No, don't kill Cedric, don't kill Cedric! Dad, help me, heeelp me! He's going to kill me! Boo-hoo!"""
3502,131,11,1,"Shut up, Dudley. I'm warning you..."
3503,131,11,31,Why should I?
3504,131,11,1,Because if you don't I'll turn you into the idiot pig you are!
3505,131,11,1,"Not so brave now, are you Duddykins? Now tell your little friends to go away."
3506,131,11,31,G-go home!
3507,131,11,148,What?
3508,131,11,31,Get out of here!
3509,131,11,1,Don't you ever speak about that again. You understand?
3510,131,11,31,Don't point that thing at me!
3511,131,11,1,"I said, DO YOU UNDERSTAND? !"
3512,131,11,31,What's happening?
3513,131,11,1,Quiet!
3514,131,11,1,Dudley! Run!
3515,131,11,1,"Come on! They break into a run. A dementor drifts into the alleyway in front of them. Skidding to a stop, Harry turns around, to find the other dementor cutting off the way back."
3516,131,11,1,"Dudley, no!"
3517,131,11,1,Lumos!
3518,131,11,1,"""Expecto Patronum!'"
3519,131,11,9,"Bow to death, Harry..."
3520,131,11,45,Haaaaaaaarry!...
3521,131,11,1,"""Expecto Patronum! '"
3522,131,8,21,What the heii are those?
3523,131,8,1,Dementors.
3524,131,8,32,"What happened, Duddikins?"
3525,131,8,21,What the hell is a dementoid?
3526,131,8,32,They didn't--?
3527,131,8,1,No.
3528,131,8,21,I want some answers!
3529,131,8,1,We were attacked.
3530,131,8,21,By those...things?
3531,131,8,1,"They're evil. If they get the chance, they'll suck your soul out through your mouth."
3532,131,8,21,How do you know that?
3533,131,8,21,"Fought 'em off, eh, Dud? Gave 'em the ol' one-two?"
3534,131,8,1,You can't give a Dementor the 'ol one-two.'
3535,131,8,21,Why is he all right then?
3536,131,8,1,Because I used magic to save his
3537,132,8,1,Lumos!
3538,132,8,21,Who are all you lot?
3539,132,8,13,"Quiet, Dursley."
3540,132,8,11,"Harry, douse the light. We're exposed here."
3541,132,8,1,What are you doing here?
3542,132,8,11,"We're your advanced guard, Harry. Dumbledore just sent us as soon as he heard about the attack. We're taking you to safety. We're just waiting for the all clear."
3543,132,8,1,How'd he know? It just happened!
3544,132,8,11,"You didn't think Dumbledore'd let you wander around on your own, did you?"
3545,132,8,11,"Harry, I don't believe you've met Nymphadora Tonks."
3546,132,8,11,"Tonks, would you go get Harry's broom from the house?"
3547,132,8,1,What's been going on? What's Lord Vol-
3548,132,8,13,"We're not talking about it here, it's too risky."
3549,132,8,13,Blast it.
3550,132,8,61,"Mad-eye, dear, you do realize that's disgusting?"
3551,132,8,13,I want 365 degree visibility on the return trip.
3552,132,8,1,How are we getting there?
3553,132,8,11,Brooms.
3554,132,8,56,There's the first signal.
3555,132,8,13,"Right, let's go."
3556,132,8,11,"On your broom, Harry."
3557,132,8,13,Form up! Form up around Harry. Make it snappy! The advanced guard surrounds Harry.
3558,132,8,61,"Stop being so cheerful, Mad-eye."
3559,132,8,13,We must be ready. This would be the perfect moment for Voldemort to strike Harry.
3560,132,8,1,"Uh, is that very likely?"
3561,132,8,56,No one's going to die.
3562,132,8,11,There's the second signal!
3563,132,8,13,"Mount your brooms, everyone. Here we go!"
3564,132,8,13,"The third signal, everyone. Let's"
3565,132,8,13,Stay in formation!
3566,132,8,13,We need more height!
3567,132,8,13,Contacts to the south!
3568,132,8,56,"Mad-eye! You, Tonks, and Lupin take Harry! We'll slow them down!"
3569,132,8,11,"There's the other one, Alastor!"
3570,132,8,1,Expecto--!
3571,132,8,11,"Harry, leave it to us!"
3572,132,8,1,No!
3573,132,8,11,"""Expecto Patronum!'"
3574,132,8,11,Get Harry to the safe house!
3575,132,8,13,"Come on, Potter! Keep moving!"
3576,132,8,1,But I can help!
3577,132,8,13,"Potter, getting yourself killed won't do a thing. Now move!"
3578,132,8,13,"We're not far, now!"
3579,132,8,13,Did you get rid of them?
3580,132,8,56,"They're gone, Alastor."
3581,132,8,61,We're there!
3582,132,8,13,Prepare for descent! Form up around Harry!
3583,133,7,11,"Stay here, Harry."
3584,133,7,56,Clear!
3585,133,7,13,"Right, Harry, this way."
3586,133,7,13,"Here, read this."
3587,133,7,13,"Come on, inside. Hurry."
3588,133,7,11,"Get in, quick, Harry. Don't touch anything."
3589,133,7,115,"Filth! Scum! Half-breeds, mutants, freaks, begone from this place! How dare you befoul the house of my fathers?!"
3590,133,7,18,"Shut up, you miserable old hag! Quiet!"
3591,133,7,115,"Blood traitor, abomination, shame of my flesh!"
3592,133,7,1,Was that your--?
3593,133,7,18,"Mother, yes. Dear old mum."
3594,133,7,1,But...why here?
3595,133,7,26,"Hello, Harry dear."
3596,133,7,1,Mrs. Weasley!
3597,133,7,26,"Sirius, the meeting is about to start!"
3598,133,7,18,Right.
3599,133,7,26,"Harry, dear, go on upstairs-- quietly, if you please. They're all up there."
3600,134,7,3,Harry!
3601,134,7,2,"Let him breathe, Hermione!"
3602,134,7,3,"Oh, Harry! We've missed you! Are you furious with us, I bet you are!"
3603,134,7,2,"Good to see you, mate."
3604,134,7,3,"Come on, inside."
3605,134,7,3,"Sorry we haven't written, Harry, but Dumbledore made us promise not to."
3606,134,7,2,"We wanted to, mate, we really did, but he thought they would get intercepted. There is an awkward silence."
3607,134,7,1,Right.
3608,134,7,2,He thought you would be safest there.
3609,134,7,3,He was so angry when he heard. It was...scary...
3610,134,7,1,"So, why's he keeping me in the dark?"
3611,134,7,1,Didn't you bother asking?
3612,134,7,2,"We've only seen him twice, and not for very long. He's really busy."
3613,134,7,1,So I get to spend the summer with the Dursleys while you two are here.
3614,134,7,2,"It's not that fun, mate. Mum won't let us anywhere near the meetings."
3615,134,7,1,You've still been here!
3616,134,7,1,What's been going on?
3617,134,7,2,"We've already told you, we're not privyed to the meetings. But we do know a few things."
3618,134,7,3,"Some of the Order are following known Death Eaters, like Lucious Malfoy."
3619,134,7,1,What's this Order everyone's talking about?
3620,134,7,3,The Order of the Phoenix. Dumbledore started it last time to fight You-Know-Who. He only reorganized it after last term.
3621,134,7,26,"You can come down now, the meeting's over."
3622,134,7,26,Arthur-
3623,134,7,18,"Well, the Ministry is furious with you."
3624,134,7,1,Why?
3625,134,7,18,You'll have to go to an disciplinary meeting tomorrow.
3626,134,7,1,Okay.
3627,134,7,1,I'm not really hungry. I think I'll go to bed.
3628,134,7,18,"You surprise me, Harry. I figured the first thing you'd do is start asking about Voldemort."
3629,134,7,1,"I wanted to, but I didn't think you'd tell me anything."
3630,134,7,26,"And that was quite right, Harry! You're much to young--"
3631,134,7,18,"He has a right to know, Molly."
3632,134,7,26,It's not your decision!
3633,134,7,18,"I know what Dumbledore said, but he needs to know something."
3634,134,7,18,"He's not a child, Molly."
3635,134,7,26,He's not an adult either!
3636,134,7,26,I only have Harry's best interests at heart.
3637,134,7,18,He's not your son.
3638,134,7,26,"Who else does he have, then?"
3639,134,7,18,He's got me. He's like a son to me.
3640,134,7,18,"What do you want to know, Harry?"
3641,134,7,1,Where's Voldemort? What's he doing?
3642,134,7,18,"He's hiding for the moment, because the Ministry is ignoring his return and he doesn't want that to change."
3643,134,7,1,How?
3644,134,7,18,The last person You-Know-Who wanted to alert was Dumbledore.
3645,134,7,1,And what's his plan?
3646,134,7,18,"He's building up his army again, just like before."
3647,134,7,1,And you're stopping him from gaining followers?
3648,134,7,11,"We're doing our best, but it's proving to be...difficult."
3649,134,7,18,"You see, when the Ministry of Magic insists that Voldemort isn't back."
3650,134,7,1,But...why?
3651,134,7,11,"Fudge likes being Minister of Magic. If it turns out that Voldemort came back under his watch, he'll be sacked."
3652,134,7,1,"But you're telling people, right?"
3653,134,7,18,"Well, they think I'm a mass- murderer, Lupin is a werewolf, Tonks and Arthur would lose their jobs at the Ministry..."
3654,134,7,11,But Dumbledore is doing all he can.
3655,134,7,16,"If he keeps it up, he might end up in Azkaban. And that would give You- Know-Who a clear field to--"
3656,134,7,1,What?
3657,134,7,18,You-Know-Who wants something. Something he didn't have last time. A weapon.
3658,134,7,1,What kind of weapon?
3659,134,7,11,"I'm sorry, Harry, we can't say anything more."
3660,134,7,26,"Morning, dear! Did you have a good sleep?"
3661,134,7,1,"No, my scar kept hurting."
3662,134,7,1,Yeah...nerves...
3663,134,7,26,"Good luck, Harry!"
3664,134,7,3,"They'll have to let you off, Harry... You were defending"
3665,134,7,1,"Thanks, Hermione."
3666,134,7,2,What does he get a hug for?
3667,134,7,2,"Oh, sure, that's why."
3668,134,7,2,"Me? Jealous? Of course not, it just doesn't seem fair that you hug one friend more than the other, is all..."
3669,134,7,3,Would you like a hug?
3670,135,70,16,"Well, come on, Harry. Time to go."
3671,135,70,1,Bye.
3672,135,70,16,"Good, good, not very many Muggles."
3673,135,70,16,"Well, come on Harry, in we go."
3674,135,70,16,"I do love using the Fellytone! Now, let's see, what's the number again..."
3675,135,70,132,Welcome to the Ministry of Magic. Please state your business.
3676,135,70,16,"Harry Potter, disciplinary hearing."
3677,135,70,132,Pleas stand by.
3678,135,70,16,"Keep close, Harry!"
3679,135,70,16,"Ah, Perkins, good morn-"
3680,135,70,112,"Arthur, they've changed the time of Potter's hearing."
3681,135,70,16,Blast! Dumbledore thought they might try that.
3682,135,70,112,It started at eight!
3683,135,70,16,"Good lord, that was five minutes ago! Come on, Harry!"
3684,135,70,132,Department of Mysteries.
3685,135,70,1,Department of Mysteries?
3686,135,70,16,"Yep, I've got no idea what they get up to in here, it's top secret."
3687,135,70,16,"Come on, Harry!"
3688,135,70,1,I've been there before...
3689,135,70,16,"Now, Harry, I find that highly unlikely..."
3690,135,70,16,"There you are, Harry, in you go...good luck..."
3691,136,70,17,You're late.
3692,136,70,1,Er...sorry.
3693,136,70,17,"No matter, the accused will take his seat."
3694,136,70,17,"Very well, we are ready to begin."
3695,136,70,4,"Witness for the Defence, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore."
3696,136,70,17,"Ah...you...er...got our message that the time had changed, did you?"
3697,136,70,17,Well. The...ah...charges.
3698,136,70,17,"The charges against the accused shall now be read into the record: That the accused did with deliberation and fore-knowledge of the illegality of his actions, produce a patronus charm in full sight of a Muggle."
3699,136,70,1,Yes.
3700,136,70,1,"Yes, but-"
3701,136,70,17,Within full sight of a Muggle?
3702,136,70,1,"Yes, but-"
3703,136,70,72,"You produced a Patronus? A fully- formed Patronus, with a clearly- defined shape?"
3704,136,70,1,Yes.
3705,136,70,72,"That is most remarkable, Mr. Potter."
3706,136,70,17,It doesn't matter how impressive it was!
3707,136,70,1,But I did it because of the Dementors!
3708,136,70,72,What do you mean?
3709,136,70,1,"My cousin and I were attacked by Dementors. That's why I had to use the Patronus, to drive them away."
3710,136,70,17,"Ah, yes, yes, another cock-and-bull story."
3711,136,70,72,Dementors in Little Whinging?
3712,136,70,17,"Oh, come now, Susan. He's clearly lying."
3713,136,70,17,We haven't got time to-
3714,136,70,17,"Very well. Weasley, fetch the witness."
3715,136,70,17,Full name?
3716,136,70,88,"Arabella Doreen Figg, resident of Little Whinging."
3717,136,70,17,So...what is your story?
3718,136,70,88,I was sitting on my porch when I saw the two Dementors gliding towards the two boys.
3719,136,70,72,What did the Dementors look like?
3720,136,70,88,"Well, they were big and wore great, tattered cloaks."
3721,136,70,72,Anything else?
3722,136,70,88,I-I felt them. It was horrible...like I would never be happy again.
3723,136,70,17,"Very well, you may go."
3724,136,70,17,Not very convincing.
3725,136,70,72,"Oh, I disagree. She described their effects very completely."
3726,136,70,17,So two Dementors just happen to be in Little Whinging? I think not...
3727,136,70,4,"Only if the Dementors are still taking their orders from only the Ministry these days. I believe you know my views on this, Cornelius."
3728,136,70,17,"Yes, and they're nothing but bilge, Dumbledore."
3729,136,70,15,"Excuse me, Dumbledore, but did you just accused the Ministry of Magic of ordering an attack on this boy?"
3730,136,70,17,Dementors are irrelevant!
3731,136,70,17,"Well, yes, if he's telling the truth!"
3732,136,70,17,"Very well, all for clearing the accused of charges?"
3733,136,70,17,All opposed?
3734,136,70,4,Excellent.
3735,137,71,16,"Harry, you've been let off! That's wonderful!"
3736,137,71,16,You were tried by the full court?
3737,137,71,1,"I think so, yeah."
3738,137,71,1,Er...is Percy mad at you?
3739,137,71,16,"Ah...yes...I'm afraid we had a bit of a row. He, well, he sided with Fudge and the rest of us sided with Dumbledore, so Percy left."
3740,137,71,23,"Well, well, if it isn't Patronus Potter."
3741,137,71,1,What are you doing here?
3742,137,71,23,"Come now, Potter, I really don't think that private matters between the Minister and myself are any concern of yours."
3743,137,71,23,Shall we continue this in your
3744,137,71,17,Certainly.
3745,137,71,1,"If he wanted to talk to the Minister, why down here?"
3746,137,71,16,"Dunno, Harry. Some things are just beyond comprehension."
3747,137,71,16,"Settle down, you three!"
3748,137,71,16,"Sirius, we saw Fudge talking with Lucius Malfoy on Level Nine again. Tell Dumbledore, next time he comes in, would you?"
3749,137,71,18,"Yeah, absolutely."
3750,137,71,16,"Well, I'd better be off. I've got a bewitched vomiting toilet to deal with."
3751,137,71,14,"George, remember that concept. Vomiting Toilet."
3752,137,71,19,"Right you are, Fred."
3753,137,71,16,"Also, I'm covering for Tonks on guard duty later tonight, so I won't be back until late."
3754,137,71,18,Harry!
3755,137,71,18,"You all right, Harry?"
3756,137,71,1,Yeah...just...my scar...the pain is getting stronger.
3757,137,71,18,"Harry, I've got something that might interest you."
3758,137,71,18,This was the original Order of the Phoenix. Found it while we were cleaning.
3759,137,71,18,"There's Mad-eye and Dumbledore, right next to Dedalus Diggle; Marlene McKinnon, she was killed two weeks after this was taken...;"
3760,137,71,18,"then there's Frank and Alice Longbottom, tortured into insanity by Death Eaters; Lupin, of course.."
3761,137,71,1,My parents.
3762,137,71,1,"I miss them, Sirius..."
3763,137,71,18,"I know, Harry, I know. I miss them too."
3764,137,71,18,It's not fair that I got to spend so much time with them and you didn't...
3765,137,71,1,"Why'd they have to die, Sirius, why?"
3766,137,71,18,"I know I'm not your father, Harry, but I'll always be there for you, if I can help it..."
3767,137,71,1,Thanks.
3768,137,71,18,"Kreacher, get out of here! Now!"
3769,137,71,48,"Oh, how the old Mistress would weep to see the traitor in her house..."
3770,137,71,1,Who..who was that?
3771,137,71,18,"Kreacher. He's been alone with the house for years, he's gone a bit funny."
3772,138,42,3,"Harry, Ron and I, we've been named House Prefects! She hands Harry a letter."
3773,138,42,3,"What about you, Harry?"
3774,138,42,3,Are you sure? I would have thought you would get one!
3775,138,42,1,I'm sure. Nothing.
3776,138,42,1,"So...congratulations Ron, Hermione..."
3777,138,42,2,"Come on, lets go back downstairs!"
3778,138,42,1,"Yes, do go enjoy yourselves."
3779,138,42,1,What is that?
3780,138,42,1,"Yes it is, it's right there!"
3781,138,42,25,"I see them too, Harry."
3782,138,42,1,Er...you are?
3783,138,42,25,Luna. Luna Lovegood.
3784,138,42,1,"Well, thanks Luna."
3785,138,42,1,Hagrid's cabin looks deserted.
3786,138,42,3,I hope he's all right...
3787,138,42,2,What if he were still on his...
3788,138,42,2,What if he's still on his mission from Dumbledore?
3789,138,42,1,"Yeah, could be."
3790,139,36,4,"I beg a few moments of your attention, as I have a few start of term announcements. Right off, our caretaker, the good Mr. Filch, has reminded me for what he says is the four-hundred and sixty-second time that he had an annually updated list of various banned items, usually introduced by our humour experts Fred and George Weasley..."
3791,139,36,4,... which are posted in an extensive list on the door to Mr. Filch's door.
3792,139,36,4,"Also, we have two staffing changes this year. Professor Grubby-Plank will be taking the post of Care of Magical Creatures post as Professor Hagrid is on...extended leave."
3793,139,36,4,"Additionally, we have Professor Umbridge, who has kindly agreed to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts--"
3794,139,36,15,"Hem, hem, Headmaster, if I could address the school?"
3795,139,36,15,"Thank you, Headmaster. Now, how are we all doing tonight? I thought I would just say a few words. I am here at the Ministry of Magic's bequest, under Educational Decree twenty-two, which states that if the Headmaster of Hogwarts is unable to fill any teaching post the Ministry shall select one for the position."
3796,139,39,75,"So why didn't your mum want you to come back to Hogwarts, Seamus?"
3797,139,39,1,What?
3798,139,39,29,Me mam didn't want me to come back to Hogwarts...
3799,139,39,1,Why?
3800,139,39,29,Well...because of you...
3801,139,39,1,What did I do?
3802,139,39,29,"She...well, she figure's you're, well...you're lying about You-Know- Who and Dumbledore's a right nutter..."
3803,139,39,1,Where'd she get that from?
3804,139,39,1,"No one believes me, Hedwig. No one..."
3805,139,39,1,I'm alone...
3806,140,30,1,"Sorry, Professor..."
3807,140,30,15,"Hmm, let's see, five points from Gryffindor for coming in late."
3808,140,30,15,"Now, as I was saying before Mr. Potter interrupted with his antics, your Defense Against the Dark Arts education has been rather fragmented and disjointed in your past classes, hasn't it?"
3809,140,30,15,"I will be following a pre-approved Ministry-prepared, theory-centered Defense lesson plan."
3810,140,30,15,Copy this down.
3811,140,30,15,Yes?
3812,140,30,3,I wanted to know something about your course aims.
3813,140,30,15,"Well, they should be perfectly self- evident."
3814,140,30,3,But surely the whole point of Defense against the dark arts is practical application?
3815,140,30,15,"Miss Granger, this class has been approved by Ministry experts. Are you a Ministry Expert?"
3816,140,30,3,"No, but-"
3817,140,30,15,"Then you have no business challenging those who are. We will be learning about spells in a safe, risk-free environment-"
3818,140,30,3,But we've got O.W.L.s coming up! You expect us to do the spells with no practice?
3819,140,30,1,What good's theory in the real world?
3820,140,30,1,What about Lord Voldemort?
3821,140,30,15,"Ten points from Gryffindor, Mr. Potter. Let me set the record straight."
3822,140,30,15,Some of you have been told that a certain dead wizard has returned. This is a lie.
3823,140,30,1,It-is-NOT-a-LIE!
3824,140,30,15,"Mr. Potter, you have just landed yourself in detention!"
3825,140,30,1,"So, according to you, Cedric Diggory dropped dead? Or are you calling me a murderer?"
3826,140,30,15,The boy's death was a tragic accident.
3827,140,30,1,It was MURDER! I saw it happen!
3828,140,30,15,"Mr Potter, you have earned yourself a week's worth of detentions!"
3829,140,30,1,"Yeah, talk to somebody who cares."
3830,140,30,15,"That goes to Professor McGonagall, dear."
3831,140,30,1,Yeah. But she called me a liar!
3832,140,30,1,"Yes, Professor."
3833,140,30,7,Good. Off you go.
3834,140,30,3,How can Dumbledore let that horrible woman teach? And when we're taking our OWL tests too!
3835,140,30,2,You reckon she's here to spy on us?
3836,140,30,3,"Well, not us specifically, but definitely Dumbledore and the Order."
3837,140,30,1,Oh! Sorry...
3838,140,30,74,"Yeah, well, you're going to have to get out of it somehow. We're holding tryouts for Keeper now Wood's gone, and I wanted to have the whole team there."
3839,140,30,1,"I'll never get out of it, Angelina."
3840,140,30,74,"Well, just...don't do it again!"
3841,140,30,2,"Well, Harry, shall we start on Snape's report?"
3842,140,30,1,"Later, I've got detention."
3843,140,30,3,"Good luck, Harry."
3844,140,30,1,Thanks.
3845,141,31,15,"Ah, Potter. Sit down."
3846,141,31,15,"You're going to be doing lines, tonight, Mr. Potter, and you'll be using this quill."
3847,141,31,15,"You will write ""I will not tell lies"" until I tell you to stop. Understand?"
3848,141,31,1,There's no ink.
3849,141,31,15,Oh...you won't need ink.
3850,141,31,15,"Problem, Potter?"
3851,141,31,15,"That's enough for this evening. Same time, tomorrow, and we'll see if we can get the message to sink in a bit deeper."
3852,141,39,3,"Hey, Harry."
3853,141,39,3,Have you seen Ron? I can't find him anywhere.
3854,141,39,1,"No, I haven't."
3855,141,39,3,He's been acting fishy all week. He's up to something.
3856,141,39,15,"That's enough for tonight, Potter. Let's see that hand."
3857,141,39,2,Harry! I tried out for Quidditch Keeper at the tryouts! I'm on the team!
3858,141,39,2,Harry--bloody hell!
3859,141,39,3,He's got to be taken to the hospital wing.
3860,141,39,2,You said she was making you do lines!
3861,141,39,1,She is. But the quill has some sort of spell on it. It uses blood for ink.
3862,141,39,3,That old hag! She's sick!
3863,141,39,1,"No, I'm telling anyone."
3864,141,39,3,"Harry, I really think you should tell--"
3865,141,39,1,No!
3866,141,39,1,I don't need his help. I don't need anyone's help.
3867,141,39,3,Hagrid's still not back yet. I hope he's all right.
3868,141,39,1,I've asked Sirius about it.
3869,141,39,3,"Harry, you can't write to him! Owls are being intercepted, it isn't safe."
3870,141,39,1,"Don't worry, Hermione, I wrote it in code. Anyway, I figured I need to tell someone about Umbridge. My scar hurt again last night in detention."
3871,141,39,2,Always knew she was a bit fishy.
3872,141,39,3,You think she's working for You- Know-Who?
3873,141,39,1,"Well, it's a possibility, isn't it?"
3874,141,39,3,"I suppose so. He could have her under the Imperious Curse, though it's unlikely. Dumbledore'd know."
3875,141,39,1,"Yeah, but Dumbledore didn't have a choice, did he? She'd been sent here by the Ministry."
3876,142,32,38,Greetings my children. I sense even now that many of you have already made the transition into the beyond!
3877,142,32,38,Today we will be continuing our interpretation of prophetic dreams. Please divide into your groups and discuss your recent night time visions using the text as a guide.
3878,142,32,15,And how long have you been at this post?
3879,142,32,15,I understand you are the descendent of the famous Seer Cassandra Trelawney?
3880,142,32,38,I am.
3881,142,32,15,And you are the first since Cassandra to have the Second Sight?
3882,142,32,38,These things tend to skip...several...generations.
3883,142,32,15,Of course.
3884,142,32,15,"Now, if you would kindly make a prediction for me?"
3885,142,32,15,The Inner Eye does not See upon command!
3886,142,32,38,"My dear boy, your dream diary, if you please!"
3887,142,32,38,My dear boy! My poor boy! These dreams are evil portends!
3888,142,32,38,"Yes, yes, oatmeal! Are you telling me you cannot see the signs? The foretelling of suffering and death?"
3889,142,32,1,Er...
3890,142,32,38,Perhaps you are not as in the beyond as the others.
3891,142,32,15,"Well, if that's the best you can do, Professor, I will be going."
3892,143,21,1,"Where are we going, Hermione?"
3893,143,21,3,There we are.
3894,143,21,2,"""The Hog's Head,"" Hermione?"
3895,143,21,3,"Come on, I'll explain in a minute."
3896,143,21,1,"Hermione, what's going on?"
3897,143,21,3,These are some people I mentioned my Defense Against the Dark Arts idea with.
3898,143,21,1,You mean about us teaching ourselves?
3899,143,21,10,"Hey, Harry."
3900,143,21,1,"Hey, Neville."
3901,143,21,1,"Uh...same to you, Luna."
3902,143,21,14,"Hear, hear!"
3903,143,21,3,"Obviously, this will help us pass our O.W.L.s, but more importantly, it gives us the ability to protect ourselves from...Lord Voldemort. Several people jump or wince in fear at the name."
3904,143,21,1,That's the first time you've said his name.
3905,143,21,116,How do we know You-Know-Who's really back?
3906,143,21,19,Dumbledore believes he is.
3907,143,21,109,You mean Dumbledore believes him.
3908,143,21,3,"That's true, but I think we're drifting from the purpose--"
3909,143,21,1,"It's okay, Hermione."
3910,143,21,1,I believe Voldemort's back because I fought him last year. Dumbledore's already told the school that. If you didn't believe him you won't believe anyone.
3911,143,21,3,"Well...anyway...uh, I think that in order to learn properly we'll need a teacher."
3912,143,21,10,But we're all students. None of us has the experience to--
3913,143,21,20,Someone here does. Everyone looks at her. She is staring directly at Harry.
3914,143,21,1,Me?
3915,143,21,119,I for one would like to know why Potter's qualified and the rest of us aren't.
3916,143,21,72,One of the portraits said you'd killed a Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets with that sword in Dumbledore's office.
3917,143,21,1,"Uh...well, yeah, I did."
3918,143,21,52,"Blimey, Harry..."
3919,143,21,65,Wow...
3920,143,21,14,Can't forget that he saved the Sorcerer's Stone from You-Know-Who in his first year.
3921,143,21,55,And last year he got through the Triwizard Tournament!
3922,143,21,2,Not to mention you dueled with You- Know-Who all alone and he still couldn't kill you!
3923,143,21,20,And you fought off those dementors that attacked you this summer.
3924,143,21,3,So all in favor of taking lessons from Harry?
3925,143,21,3,Where are we going to meet?
3926,143,21,10,What about an unused classroom?
3927,143,21,1,That might work. I'll look into that.
3928,143,21,3,"Ok, good."
3929,143,21,3,"I think we should put our names down, so we know who was here."
3930,143,21,118,"I don't know...if it were found...I mean, Umbridge wouldn't like what we're doing..."
3931,143,21,3,"Honestly, Ernie, do you think I'd just leave it lying around? Besides, its enchanted."
3932,143,21,3,"Also, what should we call ourselves?"
3933,143,21,74,What about the Anti-Unbridhe League?
3934,143,21,20,I think it should be Dumbledore's Army. There is excited agreement. Harry smiles at her.
3935,143,21,3,We'll let you know when we're going
3936,143,29,3,I think that went well.
3937,143,29,1,Yeah.
3938,143,29,3,"And did you see Cho, Harry?"
3939,143,29,3,"Well, she couldn't keep her eyes off you, could she?!"
3940,143,36,74,"Harry, you won't believe...that Umbridge woman...this is too much!!"
3941,143,36,1,What's she done now?
3942,143,36,74,Follow me.
3943,143,36,1,"""By order of the Hogwarts High Inquisitor: All student organizations, societies, teams, groups, and clubs are henceforth disbanded. Permission to reform must be approved by High Inquisitor Umbridge. No student organization can exist without the knowledge and approval of the High Inquisitor. Any student found to be a part of an illegal organization will be expelled immediately."""
3944,143,36,74,She refused to allow us to reform the Gryffindor team. We had to go to Dumbledore to get her to allow it.
3945,143,36,1,"Not only that, but what about the"
3946,143,36,1,This isn't a coincidence.
3947,143,36,1,She knows.
3948,143,36,2,She can't!
3949,143,36,1,"Look, we don't know how many people could have overheard our meeting and told her."
3950,143,36,2,Or somebody at the meeting could have blabbed to her.
3951,143,36,3,"No, they couldn't have. The parchment we all signed was enchanted, like I said. No one can betray the D.A. without us knowing."
3952,143,36,1,"What would we do without you, Hermione?"
3953,143,36,1,Hedwig!
3954,143,36,3,She's hurt!
3955,143,36,2,She doesn't look very good.
3956,143,36,3,"Harry, you'd better take her to Professor Grubby-Plank. She'll know what to do."
3957,143,36,7,Potter!
3958,143,36,7,Where on earth are you going at this time of night?
3959,143,36,1,It's Hedwig. I think she's been attacked.
3960,143,36,7,What?
3961,143,36,7,"Yes, I think you might be right, Potter. She looks at Harry."
3962,143,36,1,London.
3963,143,36,7,"Well, give her to me. I'll run her"
3964,143,36,7,There you are.
3965,143,36,7,"Bear in mind, Potter, that channels of communication in and out of Hogwarts are being watched, won't you?"
3966,143,36,1,"Yes, Professor."
3967,143,36,7,"Good. Now, off to bed."
3968,144,55,27,Mr. Harry Potter!
3969,144,55,1,Dobby! What are you doing here?
3970,144,55,27,"Dobby is cleaning, sir."
3971,144,55,1,"What is it, Dobby."
3972,144,55,27,Dobby...Dobby wishes he could help Harry Potter. Dobby has heard him muttering in his sleep.
3973,144,55,1,"Don't worry about it, Dobby. But I don't think you can help me."
3974,144,55,1,"Actually, there is something you can do, Dobby."
3975,144,55,1,I need a room where twenty-eight people can practice Defense Against the Dark Arts without the teachers knowing. Especially Professor Umbridge.
3976,144,55,27,"Dobby knows of the perfect place, Harry Potter! It is the Room of Requirement, sir. You can only use the room in times of great need. Whatever you need will be there for you, Harry Potter."
3977,144,55,1,"That's brilliant, Dobby!"
3978,144,55,27,"Dobby can show you now, if you wish, Harry Potter."
3979,144,55,1,"Better not, Dobby. School is pretty intense right now. We'll do it ina few months, before the holidays."
3980,144,55,52,...and Slytherin is up forty to ten. Alica with the quaffle!
3981,144,55,127,"Weasley is our King, Weasley is our King, He always lets the Quaffle in, Weasley is our King!"
3982,144,55,1,"Just ignore them, Ron!"
3983,144,55,12,"I should thank you, Weasley. You're definitely our best player!"
3984,144,55,3,"Harry, are you all right?"
3985,144,55,12,"Bet you loved that, Potter! Saved Weasley's neck, didn't you?"
3986,144,55,12,I've never seen a worse Keeper! Maybe we should add some more verses to our little song. About his filthy mother!
3987,144,55,12,And his pathetic loser of a father too!
3988,144,55,12,"But then, you like the Weasleys, don't you? How can you stand the stink? I guess it reminds you of your own dear mother!"
3989,144,55,50,Impedimenta!
3990,144,55,50,"Don't make me stupify you, Potter!"
3991,144,55,7,My office. Now.
3992,144,55,7,"In all my thirty-nine years at this school, I have never seen such a disgusting display."
3993,144,55,1,Malfoy provoked us.
3994,144,55,7,Of course he wanted to provoke you! He'd just lost!
3995,144,55,7,I cannot express in words the disappointment I feel right now.
3996,144,55,7,"What is it, Dolores?"
3997,144,55,15,I thought you might need some additional authority in dealing with these two.
3998,144,55,7,You thought wrong. Now kindly remove yourself from my office.
3999,144,55,7,"Now, I don't care what Malfoy said. Your performance out there was shameful. Fifty points from Gryffindor, and I'm giving you both a week's worth of detentions."
4000,144,55,15,I hardly think that's an adequate punishment for this.
4001,144,55,15,"Educational Decree Twenty-Five. It gives me, as High Inquisitor, the power to give punishments and privileges, and to alter those given out to students by other members of the staff."
4002,144,55,15,"So, I think a life-long ban from playing quidditch should do the trick for both of these. Oh, and this one's twin as well. He was going to attack Malfoy as well."
4003,144,55,1,Ban us...for life.
4004,144,55,15,"Yes, indeed, Mr. Potter."
4005,144,55,15,"Ah, I'll take your brooms as well."
4006,144,55,15,"Well, have a wonderful day."
4007,144,55,1,You've--!
4008,144,55,7,"My hands are tied, Potter."
4009,144,55,74,I can't believe it...three players banned for life in one day...
4010,144,55,2,I'm going to resign.
4011,144,55,1,You can't!
4012,144,55,2,I'm horrible! I should never have joined.
4013,144,55,1,"If you quit, we'll be out four players!"
4014,144,55,2,This is the worst day of my life.
4015,144,55,3,I know something that could cheer you up.
4016,144,55,3,Hagrid's back!
4017,145,55,1,"Hagrid, what happened to you?"
4018,145,55,5,"I've fine, I tell yeh!"
4019,145,55,2,"Come off it, Hagrid! We're not blind!"
4020,145,55,5,"Can' answer tha', I'm afraid. Top secret, that is. Business of the Order."
4021,145,55,1,"We know you were looking for giants, Hagrid. Dumbledore said so last year."
4022,145,55,5,"Oh. Well, yeah, I was, then. Went with Madame Maxime. Took us a month to get to their camp."
4023,145,55,2,A month?
4024,145,55,5,"O' course! Can' do magic, not with the Ministry followin' us all the way. Plus, giants aren't fond o' wizards. Don' trust 'em."
4025,145,55,1,So what did you do when you found them?
4026,145,55,2,So...no giants are coming?
4027,145,55,5,"Well, not righ' away. We brought our message, an' I expec' a fair few'll remember it afore teh end comes."
4028,145,55,1,Glad to see all of you could find this place all right.
4029,145,55,10,"Hey, Harry, what is all this stuff?"
4030,145,55,1,Loads of Defense Against the Dark Arts equipment. Hopefully we'll be able to get to all of it before the end of term.
4031,145,55,116,Oh please. Professor Lockhart taught us that in second year.
4032,145,55,2,Lockhart didn't teach as much as prune himself.
4033,145,55,1,"Besides, it works. I used it against You-Know-Who last June. It saved my life."
4034,145,55,1,"Right. Well, let's split into pairs and give it a go."
4035,145,55,10,Expelliarmus!
4036,145,55,1,"Well done, Neville!"
4037,145,55,1,"Look here, you lot! Neville's really got the hang of this one."
4038,145,55,10,Expelliarmus!
4039,145,55,10,I did it! I did it!
4040,145,55,1,"Never forget this spell, Neville. It could save your live some day."
4041,145,55,1,"Okay, everyone. We've done a lot today, and I've seen some great improvement. That's it for now. We'll meet back here, same time next week!"
4042,146,39,10,What's wrong with him?
4043,146,39,2,Get McGonagall! Go!
4044,146,39,2,Harry! HARRY!
4045,146,39,7,Potter!
4046,146,39,7,"Wake up, Potter. Wake up. Please..."
4047,146,39,1,Mr. Weasley's been attacked!
4048,146,39,7,"You dreamed this, Potter?"
4049,146,39,1,"No, I saw it happen! I...I was there..."
4050,146,39,7,"You're sure this happened, Potter?"
4051,146,39,7,"We're going to see the Headmaster, Potter."
4052,146,41,4,"Professor McGonagall, and...ah..."
4053,146,41,4,What can I do for you?
4054,146,41,7,"Well, Potter has had some kind of nightmare..."
4055,146,41,4,How did you see this? How were you positioned when you saw it?
4056,146,41,1,Oh. Uh...I was the snake. I saw it from the snake's perspective.
4057,146,41,4,Is Arthur seriously injured?
4058,146,41,1,Yes!
4059,146,41,4,You were listening?
4060,146,41,107,Naturally.
4061,146,41,4,Raise the alarm. We must make sure Arthur is found by the right people.
4062,146,41,4,"Many of our previous headmasters and mistresses have portraits in other institutions, allowing them to move between them."
4063,146,41,4,"Fawkes, we will need a warning."
4064,146,41,4,"Naturally, naturally."
4065,146,41,4,What news?
4066,146,41,107,I shouted until someone came. They carried him up seconds ago. He doesn't look good. Covered in blood...
4067,146,41,122,"Dumbledore, I've just seen them arrive at St. Mungos. Apperated there moments ago. He looks really bad."
4068,146,41,4,Good.
4069,146,41,4,"Minerva, the rest of the Weasleys will need to be awoken."
4070,146,41,4,Phineas.
4071,146,41,4,"Phineas, I need you to visit your other portrait. Tell Sirius what happened and that we are coming to stay for a while."
4072,146,41,113,"It's late, Dumbledore..."
4073,146,41,113,"I'm going, I'm going..."
4074,146,49,6,"Sit, Potter."
4075,146,49,6,"As you are well aware, I will be teaching you Occlumency. The headmaster feels you should learn this form of magic to defend yourself against the Dark Lord, who is skilled at Legilimency."
4076,146,49,1,"What's that, Professor?"
4077,146,49,6,Legilimency is the ability to extract thoughts and feelings from others.
4078,146,49,1,Voldemort can read minds?
4079,146,49,6,"As usual, you have all the subtlety of a stone wall, Potter."
4080,146,49,6,"The mind is not a book, of which any page can be examined. The mind is complex and multi-layered."
4081,146,49,1,So he could read our minds right now?
4082,146,49,1,"But hasn't it helped so far? I mean, it saved Mr. Weasley's life, didn't it?"
4083,146,49,6,"Yes, it did, but at the expense of our advantage. The connection between you was so powerful during your vision of the snake that the Dark Lord became aware of it. The Headmaster fears that he may try to use this to his advantage, to manipulate you through false visions."
4084,146,49,6,"Wand out, Potter."
4085,146,49,6,You may use any spell you can think of to try and repel me.
4086,146,49,1,What are you going to do?
4087,146,49,6,I am going to break into your mind.
4088,146,49,1,No!
4089,146,49,6,"Well, you stopped me eventually. Ideally, you should repel me with your mind."
4090,146,49,6,"Clear your mind, Potter. Abandon"
4091,146,49,16,"Come on, Harry!"
4092,146,49,1,I've been there before...
4093,146,49,6,What was that?
4094,146,49,1,I've just realized...
4095,146,49,6,"Realized what, Potter?"
4096,146,49,1,"What's in the Department of Mysteries, sir?"
4097,146,49,6,What did you say?
4098,146,49,1,"That corridor, I've been dreaming about it for months...it leads to the Department of Mysteries, I'm sure of it."
4099,146,49,6,"There are many things in the Department of Mysteries, Potter, none of which concern you."
4100,147,58,15,I can do whatever I wish!
4101,147,58,38,This is my home!
4102,147,58,15,Not anymore.
4103,147,58,15,Now remove yourself from this castle!
4104,147,58,15,"I have the authority, Headmaster!"
4105,147,58,4,"Oh, I agree with you, Professor Umbridge. You do have the power to dismiss my teachers. However..."
4106,147,58,4,-..-You cannot send them from this
4107,147,58,15,And what of her quarters when I appoint a new teacher.
4108,147,58,4,"Happily, that will not be necessary. I have found a successor"
4109,147,58,4,...the Ministry can only appoint new teachers if I cannot find one. I think you will find him suitable enough.
4110,147,58,4,This is Firenze.
4111,147,7,2,So you're saying this weapon You- Know-Who's after is in the Department of Mysteries?
4112,147,7,1,It's got to be.
4113,147,7,3,That's got to be what Surgis Podmore was doing in the Ministry when he was arrested.
4114,147,7,1,"Probably. Mr. Weasley was probably there when he was attacked, too. That must be what the Order's guarding!"
4115,147,7,2,But why the Department of Mysteries?
4116,147,7,3,"It makes perfect sense, Ron. It's got to be something the Ministry's been developing. Something top secret."
4117,147,7,3,Look at this. There's been a mass escape from Azkaban.
4118,147,7,2,Bloody hell!
4119,147,7,1,They're all Death Eaters!
4120,147,7,3,Yes.
4121,147,7,1,Voldemort.
4122,147,41,15,Since I had received information some time ago that Potter and a number of other students had met in the Hog's Head to start an illegal group--
4123,147,41,4,"I'm not sure that's true, Professor."
4124,147,41,15,I'm sorry?
4125,147,41,4,"In point of fact, when young Potter met those students it was not illegal."
4126,147,41,15,"But two days later, Educational Decree Twenty-Four was introduced."
4127,147,41,4,"Again, quite correct. However, I wonder if you have any evidence that proves this group has been meeting since then?"
4128,147,41,15,I have a witness right here!
4129,147,41,4,"Correct again. I must confess that I was, however, under the impression that this young girl only told you a meeting was going on tonight."
4130,147,41,15,"Let's ask her, shall we?"
4131,147,41,15,You can shake your head for an
4132,147,41,15,"What do you mean by shaking your head, girl?"
4133,147,41,15,But what about Potter? He was the
4134,147,41,15,"Why are you shaking your head, girl?"
4135,147,41,4,"Again, I cannot have you manhandling my students, Professor Umbridge."
4136,147,41,15,"My apologies, Headmaster. I forgot myself."
4137,147,41,17,"Well, what about the meeting tonight?"
4138,147,41,17,"So, Dumbledore, you've been behind this whole thing."
4139,147,41,4,"Well, Minister. You've caught me."
4140,147,41,17,This has all been your doing! You've been recruiting students for your army!
4141,147,41,4,"Quite correct, Cornelius."
4142,147,41,17,I knew it! I KNEW it! You've been plotting against me all this time!
4143,147,41,17,This is too good to be true!
4144,147,41,1,"Professor, no!"
4145,147,41,4,"Quiet, Harry!"
4146,147,41,17,"Yes, shut up, Potter. So, you'll be coming with us to the Ministry--"
4147,147,41,4,"Ah, yes. I was wondering when we'd hit that little snag."
4148,147,41,17,"I see no snag, Dumbledore."
4149,147,41,4,But I do. You seem to be laboring under the delusion that I would 'come quietly.'
4150,147,41,17,"Resisting arrest, now are you, Dumbledore?"
4151,147,41,17,"You would really take on two Aurors, Dolores, and myself, Dumbledore?"
4152,147,41,4,"Naturally. All of you did rather well on your spellwork at this school, but if you attempt to take me in by force, I'm afraid I shall have to hurt you."
4153,147,41,4,Are you all right?
4154,147,41,7,"Yes, we're fine."
4155,147,41,4,I'm not going into hiding. Fudge will soon regret removing me from Hogwarts.
4156,147,41,1,"I'm so sorry, Professor!"
4157,147,41,4,"It's fine. Now listen to me, Harry. Keep studying Occlumency! Do everything Professor Snape tells you."
4158,147,41,4,"Close your mind! You will understand, in time. Fudge is stirring."
4159,147,41,4,Lay back down. They must not think we have had time to talk.
4160,147,41,17,Find him!
4161,147,36,15,"""By Order of the Ministry of Magic: Dolores Jane Umbridge will replace Albus Dumbledore as Head of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."""
4162,147,36,15,"My first act as your new Headmistress is to form an Inquisitional Squad, lead by Draco Malfoy. They will report directly to me about the goings on in the halls of this school."
4163,147,36,15,"Furthermore, our good caretaker, Mr. Filch has requested we reinstate the 'old punishments.' I have decided that there is no reason we shouldn't."
4164,148,35,1,Are you sure you can't? Hagrid said it was important.
4165,148,35,2,"No way. Quidditch practice. If I don't show up, Angelina'll go mad."
4166,148,35,3,Hagrid...we've been walking for a good hour.
4167,148,35,5,"Its jus' up ahead, here."
4168,148,35,1,"Could you tell us what it is, Hagrid, please?"
4169,148,35,5,"All righ'. Well, I'm showin' yeh this, because tha' Umbridge woman put me on probation. I can' last much longer afore I get sacked like Trelawney."
4170,148,35,3,We won't let her!
4171,148,35,3,Of course we'll help.
4172,148,35,5,Knew yeh'd say yes!
4173,148,35,5,"Okay, real quiet like from here on."
4174,148,35,5,There we are!
4175,148,35,3,"Hagrid, I thought none of them wanted to come!"
4176,148,35,5,"None o' them did, Hermione! I didn' have much ruddy choice inna matter! I couldn' leave 'im!"
4177,148,35,3,"Oh, why, Hagrid? Why?"
4178,148,35,5,He's me brother!
4179,148,35,5,"Well, half-brother anyway. Me mum had 'im afore she died."
4180,148,35,5,Here. I'll introduce yeh to Grawp!
4181,148,35,5,"Yeh all righ', Grawp?"
4182,148,35,5,"Look wha' I brough' yeh, Grawpy! Two new friends an' all. We 'ave Harry Potter here, see? An' over here is Hermy."
4183,148,35,93,Hermy!
4184,148,35,5,Bad Grawpy! Bad boy!
4185,148,35,5,"We don' attack our friends, Grawpy!"
4186,148,35,5,"See, he don' know any better."
4187,148,35,5,"Anyway, all yeh need teh do is go an' talk to 'im. Give 'ima bit o' company."
4188,148,35,5,Oh blimey...
4189,148,35,97,"I thought we told you that you were no longer welcome in this place, Hagrid. You or that beast you brought from afar."
4190,148,35,5,S'not up to you who comes and goes in this forest.
4191,148,35,97,You stopped us from invoking our punishments on Firenze for becoming the servant of the humans at
4192,148,35,5,"Stopped yeh from committin' murder, yeh mean!"
4193,148,35,5,"Well, you'll tolerate 'im as long as he's here!"
4194,148,35,97,"We allow you to pass this time, Hagrid, because you have young with you. But the next time you enter this forest, your life is forfeit."
4195,149,49,6,"Have you been practicing, Potter?"
4196,149,49,1,Yeah.
4197,149,49,6,"Well, we shall see, won't we?"
4198,149,49,18,"Put that away, James."
4199,149,49,18,I'm bored. Wish it was full moon.
4200,149,49,11,Easy for you to say.
4201,149,49,42,"This should cheer you up, Sirius. Look. Sirius grins."
4202,149,49,42,"All right, there, Snivellus?"
4203,149,49,18,Expelliarmus!
4204,149,49,42,Impedimenta!
4205,149,49,6,You just wait...
4206,149,49,42,"And now, the moment you've all been waiting for--"
4207,149,49,45,"Leave him alone, James Potter!"
4208,149,49,42,"Another charity case, Lily?"
4209,149,49,45,What has he done to you?
4210,149,49,42,"Nothing. It's more the fact that he exists, you see..."
4211,149,49,6,Semper---
4212,149,49,42,Levicorpus!
4213,149,49,45,"Leave him alone, Potter!"
4214,149,49,42,I will if you go out with me.
4215,149,49,45,I wouldn't go out with you if it were a choice between you and the giant squid! Now let him down.
4216,149,49,18,Locomotor mortis!
4217,149,49,45,"I said, leave him alone!"
4218,149,49,42,"Don't make me hex you, Lily."
4219,149,49,45,Then let him go!
4220,149,49,42,Fine!
4221,149,49,42,"You're lucky Lily was here, Snivellus!"
4222,149,49,6,I don't need help from a mud-blood like her!
4223,149,49,42,Apologize to her! Now!
4224,149,49,45,"Don't make him apologize. Honestly, you're as bad as he is!"
4225,149,49,42,I would never call you that.
4226,149,49,45,"You make me sick, Potter."
4227,149,49,42,Lily! Hey Lily!
4228,149,49,6,"Having fun, Potter?"
4229,149,49,6,Been enjoying yourself?
4230,149,49,1,No!
4231,149,49,6,"Amusing man, your father..."
4232,149,49,1,I--sorry!
4233,149,49,6,You will repeat what you saw to no
4234,149,49,1,"No, of course not!"
4235,149,49,6,"You had better not, Potter, or you will experience a pain so horrible you will wish you had never been born!"
4236,149,49,6,Now get out of my sight! Do not set foot in this office ever again!
4237,150,36,9,"Can you reach it? Can you take it for me, Black?"
4238,150,36,18,I would rather die!
4239,150,36,9,"Oh, you will die. Eventually. But there are hours, even days of pain awaiting you before then."
4240,150,36,9,"I'm going to enjoy this, Black. I have you, and soon I shall have the weapon. And then not even your pathetic Order can stand in my way! Voldemort laughs, a horrible spine-chilling laugh."
4241,150,36,108,"Are you all right, Potter?"
4242,150,36,108,"Pressure of exams. It happens. Take a breath, and maybe you'll be ready to go back in. Time is nearly up, but---"
4243,150,36,1,"No--no, I've done all I can."
4244,150,36,2,You all right?
4245,150,36,1,Voldemort! He's got Sirius! In the Department of Mysteries!
4246,150,36,3,How do you know?
4247,150,36,1,I just saw it.
4248,150,36,1,How're we going to get there?
4249,150,36,2,To the Department of Mysteries?
4250,150,36,1,We've got to do something!
4251,150,36,3,"How'd Voldemort get into the Ministry of Magic without being seen? I mean, he and Sirius are the two most wanted wizards in the world..."
4252,150,36,2,Yeah. They can't just waltz into the Ministry of Magic!
4253,150,36,3,"It just seems so unlikely, Harry!"
4254,150,36,1,I won't let Sirius die!
4255,150,36,20,We heard Harry yelling. What's up?
4256,150,36,1,Voldemort's broken into the Department of Mysteries. He's got Sirius there!
4257,150,36,3,"Think, Harry! Voldemort knows you! He knows you'd rush off to save Sirius."
4258,150,36,1,"There isn't anyone else, Hermione! Everyone from the Order is gone!"
4259,150,36,20,Anything we can do to help?
4260,150,36,1,"No, there isn't!"
4261,150,36,3,"Yes, they can, Harry."
4262,150,36,1,How?
4263,150,36,3,"Before we do anything, we need to establish that Sirius really isn't at Headquarters. Which means we'll need to break into Umbridge's office."
4264,150,36,19,Might be able to.
4265,150,36,14,Just give us a few seconds.
4266,150,36,3,"Mind you, it's got to be really good!"
4267,150,36,14,It's been too quiet around here
4268,150,36,19,Time we did some real damage to this place.
4269,150,36,3,We'll also need to keep everyone away from her office.
4270,150,36,20,We can do that! Me and Luna'll guard the hallway.
4271,150,36,3,We'll probably only manage five minutes or so.
4272,150,36,1,That's all we'll need.
4273,150,36,14,"Right. You've got ten minutes to get to Umbridge's office. And whatever you do, stay away from the Astronomy Tower for the next couple of hours."
4274,150,36,19,"Unless they spread, in which case, I'd get out of the castle for a while."
4275,150,36,3,"Break out your Invisibility Cloak, Harry."
4276,150,36,35,Professor! It's those Weasley twins! They've set something off in the Astronomy Tower!
4277,150,36,15,Ready to try out the old punishments again?
4278,150,36,1,Grimmauld Place!
4279,150,36,14,That was worth it!
4280,150,36,35,I've got you now!
4281,150,36,14,"Thank you for playing, one and all."
4282,150,36,19,"And now, we've got to go!"
4283,150,36,1,Sirius! Lupin? Hello?
4284,150,36,48,What's this? The Potter boy in the fire...
4285,150,36,1,"Kreacher, where's Sirius?"
4286,150,36,48,Master went out.
4287,150,36,15,"So, turning a hallway into a swamp is funny, is it?"
4288,150,36,14,"Fairly amusing, yeah."
4289,150,36,15,"Well, now you're going to learn what happens to wrongdoers in my school."
4290,150,36,14,This was never your school! Hogwarts is Dumbledore's school!
4291,150,36,15,"Well, now you're going to get your"
4292,150,36,19,"You know, I don't think we are."
4293,150,36,14,"George, I think we've outgrown full- time education. Wouldn't you agree?"
4294,150,36,19,"Completely, Fred."
4295,150,36,14,Time to enter the real world?
4296,150,36,19,Definitely.
4297,150,36,14,Accio brooms!
4298,150,36,19,Accio brooms!
4299,150,36,14,We won't be seeing you.
4300,150,36,19,"Yeah, don't bother writing."
4301,150,36,14,Be sure to visit us at our new premises on Diagon Alley!
4302,150,36,1,"You know where he is, don't you?"
4303,150,36,48,Master does not tell Kreacher where he goes.
4304,150,36,48,Master will never return from the Department of Mysteries!
4305,151,30,15,You think you could simply walk into my office without me knowing about it? Foolish boy!
4306,151,30,15,Accio wand!
4307,151,30,15,Who were you trying to contact?
4308,151,30,1,It's none of your business.
4309,151,30,15,"Draco, would you fetch Professor Snape, please?"
4310,151,30,15,"Very well, Potter. I have been patient enough with you."
4311,151,30,6,You wished to see me?
4312,151,30,15,I have just caught Potter trying to communicate with someone in my fire. I need some Veritaserum. Truth syrum.
4313,151,30,6,"Well, it appears that I cannot help you. I have none."
4314,151,30,1,He's got Padfoot at the place it's hidden!
4315,151,30,6,"Potter, if I want nonsense shouted at me, I shall inform you. He sweeps from the office. Umbridge is enraged."
4316,151,30,15,"We've played nicely, Potter. You"
4317,151,30,15,You could have saved me a lot of trouble if those Dementors I sent to your house had finished you off!
4318,151,30,1,You sent the Dementors?
4319,151,30,15,Of course I did! Someone had to act!
4320,151,30,3,"No! Please, stop!"
4321,151,30,15,"Well, well."
4322,151,30,1,"Hermione, no!"
4323,151,30,3,"We have to tell her, Harry..."
4324,151,30,1,I would rather die!
4325,151,30,15,"Shut up, Potter! Now talk, you silly girl! Who were you talking to?"
4326,151,30,3,We were trying to find Professor Dumbledore. We had to tell him...
4327,151,30,15,Tell him?
4328,151,30,3,That it's ready. The weapon.
4329,151,30,15,You and Mr. Potter will take me to it.
4330,151,35,15,"Much further, is it?"
4331,151,35,3,"Oh, yes. It's very well hidden."
4332,151,35,103,What are you doing in our forest?
4333,151,35,15,Your forest? This forest belongs to the Ministry of Magic!
4334,151,35,15,"Stay back, you beasts!"
4335,151,35,15,You cannot attack me! Any attack on a wizard by a half-breed--
4336,151,35,3,Don't call them that!
4337,151,35,103,You dare to insult us?
4338,151,35,15,Come no closer!
4339,151,35,15,Incarcerous!
4340,151,35,15,Ingrates! Animals! Filthy half- bloods!
4341,151,35,147,What of these two?
4342,151,35,147,They have been here with Hagrid. They have heard the warnings and disobeyed. They must suffer the consequences!
4343,151,35,12,"God, I can't wait until all you Weasleys have been expelled. Your stench has been fouling this castle for too long."
4344,151,35,2,"Shut up, Malfoy!"
4345,151,35,12,"That's for speaking to me. You know, you Weasleys are just as bad as Mudbloods!"
4346,151,35,12,"You know, Weasley, it's really too bad Potter saved you from the Chamber of Secrets."
4347,151,35,2,Stupify!
4348,151,35,10,Expelliarmus!
4349,151,35,93,Haggar!
4350,151,35,93,Hermy! Where Haggar?
4351,151,35,3,"Grawp, help us!"
4352,151,35,93,Grawp save Hermy!
4353,151,35,1,"Great plan, Hermione."
4354,151,35,3,I thought it worked out rather nicely.
4355,151,35,2,That's just what we were wondering.
4356,151,35,2,"So, how do we get to the Ministry?"
4357,151,35,3,I'd imagine we should fly.
4358,151,35,1,We've got no brooms.
4359,151,35,25,There are other ways to fly.
4360,151,35,25,"I mean, they can fly, and they're"
4361,151,35,1,What are those?
4362,151,35,2,What are what?
4363,151,35,3,"There's nothing there, Harry."
4364,151,35,25,"Yes, there is. They're Thestrals. You can't see them unless you've seen someone die."
4365,151,35,10,I can see them too.
4366,151,35,1,"All right, then. Get on one, and we'll be off."
4367,151,35,2,And what about those of us who can't see them? Luna comes over to them.
4368,151,35,25,I'll show you.
4369,151,35,2,Never again...
4370,152,70,20,"What now, Harry?"
4371,152,70,1,"All right, come on."
4372,152,70,132,Department of Mysteries.
4373,152,70,1,Where is everyone?
4374,152,70,20,The Ministry closed a half-hour ago. I expect they all went home.
4375,152,70,1,That's how Voldemort got in unnoticed.
4376,152,70,1,This is it. Come on.
4377,152,70,1,Stay close.
4378,152,70,20,Now where?
4379,152,70,1,"I don't understand. In my dream,"
4380,152,70,3,"Well, let's try a few."
4381,152,70,1,Yeah. I'll know the way when I see it.
4382,152,70,1,Who's there?
4383,152,70,1,Sirius?
4384,152,70,3,"There's no one here, Harry. This isn't the right room."
4385,152,70,1,Does anyone else hear that?
4386,152,70,25,I do. It's coming from the Veil.
4387,152,70,25,There are people in there!
4388,152,70,2,"What do you mean, people?"
4389,152,70,3,"Harry, I think we should leave."
4390,152,70,1,Sirius...yeah...
4391,152,70,1,Alohomora!
4392,152,70,1,"Whatever's in there, the Ministry sure doesn't want anyone getting to it."
4393,152,70,1,This is it! Come on!
4394,152,70,1,This is it. This is where Sirius is!
4395,152,70,1,He's in here somewhere.
4396,152,70,3,I don't think Sirius is here.
4397,152,70,2,"Harry, have you seen this?"
4398,152,70,2,Er...it's got your name on it.
4399,152,70,1,What's my name doing here?
4400,152,70,3,"Don't touch it, Harry!"
4401,152,70,1,Why not?
4402,152,70,10,"Yeah, Harry, don't."
4403,152,70,1,It's got my name on it!
4404,152,70,23,"I warned you before that one day you would come to a sticky end, Potter."
4405,152,70,1,Where's Sirius?
4406,152,70,23,"We don't have him, if that's what you mean. Harry is stunned."
4407,152,70,23,"The Dark Lord knows your weakness for heroics, Potter. All it took was a little nudge to get you here."
4408,152,70,23,Now give me that prophesy.
4409,152,70,1,What prophesy?
4410,152,70,23,That prophesy. Now hand it over or we'll have to use wands on you.
4411,152,70,1,Go ahead.
4412,152,70,23,"Very brave of you, Potter. Or are you foolish?"
4413,152,70,1,Come and find out!
4414,152,70,23,"Really, Potter. You expect to defeat all of us with your little school friends? Now hand it over, and they won't have to die here."
4415,152,70,22,I haven't escaped from Azkaban for this!
4416,152,70,23,No! If the prophesy is smashed--
4417,152,70,22,Take the youngest girl. We'll see how committed Potter is as we torture her.
4418,152,70,1,You even try to take her and I'll smash this thing.
4419,152,70,1,"So, what kind of prophesy are we talking about here?"
4420,152,70,22,"Surely you jest, Potter?"
4421,152,70,1,Not really. How come Voldemort wants it?
4422,152,70,23,You dare to speak the Dark Lord's name?
4423,152,70,22,Silence! How dare you utter that name from your half--blood mouth!
4424,152,70,1,"Hey, did you know Voldemort's a half-blood too?"
4425,152,70,23,"Control yourself, Bellatrix!"
4426,152,70,1,What's so special about this
4427,152,70,23,You mean Dumbledore never told you the reason you bear that scar was hidden here?
4428,152,70,1,What?
4429,152,70,23,So that's what took you so long. We wondered.
4430,152,70,23,"Only a person for whom the prophesy was made can remove it from its self, Potter, and the Dark Lord certainly couldn't get it himself."
4431,152,70,1,"So he used me to do his dirty work, did he?"
4432,152,70,1,Now!
4433,152,70,3,Stupify!
4434,152,70,23,Stop them!
4435,152,70,3,Colloportus!
4436,152,70,1,Where'd the rest go?
4437,152,70,3,"Harry, they went the wrong way!"
4438,152,70,129,They might have gone on to the hall.
4439,152,70,22,Check under the desks.
4440,152,70,1,Stupify!
4441,152,70,22,Avada--
4442,152,70,10,Expelliarmus!
4443,152,70,1,Stupify!
4444,152,70,1,Ron!
4445,152,70,129,Impedimenta!
4446,152,70,129,We've got him!
4447,152,70,3,Silenco! Stupify!
4448,152,70,1,Pretificus Totalus!
4449,152,70,10,Stupify!
4450,152,70,1,Hermione!
4451,152,70,1,"Please don't be dead, please don't be dead... He shakes her."
4452,152,70,10,What's they do to her?
4453,152,70,10,"She's alive, Harry. There's a pulse."
4454,152,70,1,Can we carry her?
4455,152,70,10,I'll do it. You're better at fighting.
4456,152,70,10,Where do we go?
4457,152,70,1,I don't know...
4458,152,70,1,What happened.
4459,152,70,20,I think my ankle's broken. And somebody hit Ron with a weird spell...
4460,152,70,2,"Hiyya, Harry."
4461,152,70,25,They hit her with something too.
4462,152,70,1,"We need to get out of here. Luna, can you help Ginny?"
4463,152,70,22,There they are!
4464,152,70,23,"Your race is run, Potter. Hand it over."
4465,152,70,1,Let my friends go and I will.
4466,152,70,23,You are not in a position to negotiate.
4467,152,70,10,"Don't do it, Harry! Don't!"
4468,152,70,1,"Stop, Neville!"
4469,152,70,22,Neville? Neville Longbottom?
4470,152,70,22,"My dear boy, I paid your parents a visit a long time ago. We had such a time!"
4471,152,70,10,You put them in St. Mungos!
4472,152,70,22,"So, Potter. Give us the Prophesy or I'll see how long it takes to crack Longbottom like his parents."
4473,152,70,10,Don't give it to them!
4474,152,70,22,Crucio!
4475,152,70,1,Are you all right?
4476,152,70,10,Yeah...
4477,152,70,129,Give me the prophesy!
4478,153,70,18,"Get out of here, you two!"
4479,153,70,18,That will take you back out of the Department of Mysteries.
4480,153,70,1,You come with us!
4481,153,70,18,"You're the important one, now, Harry. I have to help the Order."
4482,153,70,18,"I'll always be here for you, Harry. Now go!"
4483,153,70,18,"Hello, cousin!"
4484,153,70,23,Potter!
4485,153,70,23,"We may have lost the prophesy, but I can still deliver you to the Dark Lord!"
4486,153,70,23,Stupify!
4487,153,70,1,Protego!
4488,153,70,10,It's Dumbledore!
4489,153,70,18,"Is that the best you've got, cousin?"
4490,153,70,11,Harry! HARRY!...he's gone...there's nothing you can do...
4491,153,70,1,No...no...no....
4492,153,70,11,"Harry, no!"
4493,154,70,22,"You can't stop me, Potter!"
4494,154,70,1,I'LL KILL you!!
4495,154,70,1,Stupify!
4496,154,70,22,"Come out, come out, Potter..."
4497,154,70,22,"Well, well, have you come to avenge your dear Godfather?"
4498,154,70,1,Crucio!
4499,154,70,22,Crucio!
4500,154,70,22,"Never used an Unforgivable Curse before, have you, Potter? You have to mean it, you have to want to cause the pain in your very soul..."
4501,154,70,22,Give me the prophesy!
4502,154,70,1,Can't. It got smashed by accident!
4503,154,70,22,You lie!
4504,154,70,1,"How's Voldemort going to like that? You've failed him, and he's not very forgiving, is he?"
4505,154,70,22,"Forgive me, Master! I tried, I--"
4506,154,70,1,"He can't hear you from here, you know!"
4507,154,70,9,"So, you smashed my prophesy..."
4508,154,70,9,"I grow tired of you continually thwarting my plans, Harry Potter!"
4509,154,70,9,Avada Kadavra!
4510,155,70,4,"You should not have come here tonight, Tom."
4511,155,70,9,"It is you who made that mistake, Dumbledore!"
4512,155,70,9,Avada Kedavra!
4513,155,70,9,"You do not seek to kill me, Dumbledore?"
4514,155,70,4,"There are other ways to destroy a man, Tom."
4515,155,70,9,There is nothing worse than death!
4516,155,70,4,"You are quite wrong, Tom, as you have always been."
4517,155,70,1,Look out!
4518,155,70,1,Professor!
4519,155,70,4,"Stay where you are, Harry!"
4520,155,70,4,Harry!
4521,155,70,4,"Are you all right, Harry?"
4522,155,70,37,"Minister, I saw him! You-Know-Who! He was right there!"
4523,155,70,17,I know...I saw him too...
4524,155,70,4,"If you and your men will proceed to the Death Room, you will find several Death Eaters which I and some others have apprehended."
4525,155,70,17,Seize him!
4526,155,70,4,"Minister, you have just seen You- Know-Who in the flesh only seconds ago! It is time to come to your senses!"
4527,155,70,4,"If you insist on trying to arrest me, I am perfectly willing demonstrate how useless such an attempt will be."
4528,155,70,17,"Dumbledore, what the blazes happened here?"
4529,155,70,4,"I will explain everything, Minister. Just as soon as I return Harry to school."
4530,155,70,17,What's he doing here? And what's happened to him?
4531,155,70,4,"Minister, you will order the removal of Dolores Umbridge from my school."
4532,155,70,4,All Educational Decrees will be nullified and you will call off the search on Hagrid so he can return to work.
4533,155,70,4,"I will return here later tonight, after I have seen to Harry. It should not take long. He taps the Golden centaur head."
4534,155,70,4,Portus.
4535,155,70,17,"Dumbledore, I want some answers!"
4536,155,70,4,"The Second War has begun, Minister."
4537,155,70,4,Thank you...
4538,156,41,4,"Please sit, Harry."
4539,156,41,4,"I understand how you feel, Harry--"
4540,156,41,1,No you don't!
4541,156,41,4,"You forget that Sirius was my friend too. You are not the only person on this earth capable of feelings, Harry."
4542,156,41,4,"There is no shame in feeling pain, Harry. It is your greatest strength..."
4543,156,41,1,You don't have a clue! You can't possibly know!
4544,156,41,4,What can't I know?
4545,156,41,4,"This pain is part of being human, Harry..."
4546,156,41,1,I don't care! I don't care!
4547,156,41,4,You do care. You care so much you feel like you will bleed to death because of it.
4548,156,41,1,Let me out.
4549,156,41,4,No.
4550,156,41,1,You can't keep me in here!
4551,156,41,4,"I daresay I can. And if you actually do attack me with that wand, Harry, I'm afraid to say you will regret it."
4552,156,41,4,It is my fault Sirius died tonight.
4553,156,41,4,"Harry, I owe you this explanation, to show you the failings of an old man."
4554,156,41,1,I already know all this.
4555,156,41,4,"Haven't you wondered why I haven't spoken to you, even looked at you, for months?"
4556,156,41,1,"Well, yeah, I did..."
4557,156,41,4,"Sirius told me you believed there was a snake inside of you. This was Voldemort attempting to manipulate you. To protect you from this, I had you study Occlumency."
4558,156,41,1,But Snape stopped giving me lessons.
4559,156,41,4,"Yes. I thought he could overcome his feelings towards your father, but I was wrong. Some wounds cut too deep to be healed."
4560,156,41,1,"He barely taught me, though. I always felt more open to it after the lessons. Like he was trying to open me to Voldemort--"
4561,156,41,4,"I would trust Severus Snape with my life, Harry. You have never recovered from your mistrust of him in your first year."
4562,156,41,1,Sirius didn't trust him. Didn't believe he'd really turned to our side...
4563,156,41,4,"Again, some wounds run too deep to be healed, Harry. Severus and Sirius never liked each other at school. This has never changed."
4564,156,41,4,"During your Occulumency lessons, Professor Snape discovered that you were dreaming about the door in the Department of Mysteries."
4565,156,41,1,"I've been dreaming about that all year, before Voldemort discovered the connection."
4566,156,41,4,"Yes. Voldemort has been obsessed with hearing that prophesy since he returned. Because of your scar, what he was obsessed with, you were obsessed with, in the form of dreams."
4567,156,41,4,"Once he discovered the connection, Voldemort had little difficulty in manipulating you into thinking he had captured Sirius."
4568,156,41,1,But I checked Grimmauld Place! Kreacher said--
4569,156,41,4,Kreacher lied. He wanted you to go to the Department of Mysteries.
4570,156,41,1,Why?
4571,156,41,4,Kreacher has been serving two masters for some months now.
4572,156,41,1,What?
4573,156,41,1,"Wait, where was Sirius when I tried to contact him?"
4574,156,41,4,Ah. Apparently Kreacher had injured Buckbeak to distract him in case you tried to contact Headquarters.
4575,156,41,4,Sirius was tending to the wounds when you called.
4576,156,41,1,And Hermione said we should be nice to Kreacher!
4577,156,41,4,"She was quite right, Harry. Kreacher is what wizards have made him. He is to be pitied, not hated."
4578,156,41,1,Sirius hated him.
4579,156,41,4,He didn't hate Kreacher himself. Kreacher was a reminder to Sirius of the home he had always hated.
4580,156,41,1,"Yeah, he really hated that place. And you kept him locked up in there!"
4581,156,41,4,I was trying to save his life!
4582,156,41,4,I also knew that Voldemort would return one day. I played to his weakness. There is an ancient magic which Voldemort has always underestimated.
4583,156,41,4,"This magic is what your mother gave you when she died. That protection would only work, however, if you were cared for by a blood relative. Your Aunt, Petunia."
4584,156,41,1,She never loved me.
4585,156,41,4,"Perhaps not. But she took you in, however grudgingly. As long as you can call your Aunt's house your home, you are protected."
4586,156,41,4,"And now we come to the moment of terrible truth, the moment I have dreaded for fifteen years. The moment when I must lay another burden atop your already straining shoulders."
4587,156,41,4,Do you remember your first year here? When you lay in the hospital wing fresh from your confrontation with Voldemort?
4588,156,41,4,Do you remember what you asked me that night?
4589,156,41,1,I asked you why Voldemort tried to kill me.
4590,156,41,4,"You have no idea the pain it causes me to tell it to you, even now. But unfortunately, I must."
4591,156,41,1,"I don't understand, Professor."
4592,156,41,1,"Professor, why am I so important to"
4593,156,41,4,"An excellent question, Harry. The answer lies in the prophesy."
4594,156,41,1,"Sir, it got smashed."
4595,156,41,4,That was not the only place the Prophesy is preserved.
4596,156,41,38,"""The One with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches....Born to"
4597,156,41,1,"I'm not sure I understand all that, sir..."
4598,156,41,1,And...it means me?
4599,156,41,4,"Interestingly, there were two boys whom the prophesy could have been referring to. You and Neville Longbottom."
4600,156,41,1,"So it's not necessarily me, sir?"
4601,156,41,1,What if he chose wrong?
4602,156,41,1,Why didn't he wait? Why attack when we were babies?
4603,156,41,4,"Voldemort had an informant listening to my meeting with Professor Trelawney. Fortunately he was discovered before he could hear the entire prophesy. Voldemort had to act immediately, he didn't know the rest of the prophesy. All he knew was that he had to destroy the child who would grow to be a threat to his power."
4604,156,41,1,But I don't have any special powers.
4605,156,41,4,There is a room in the Department of Mysteries which is kept locked at all times. It contains a force so wonderful and yet terrible that it is greater than death itself. It is that power which you have incredible amounts of and of which Voldemort has none.
4606,156,41,1,"What is it, sir?"
4607,156,41,4,"There is only the end of the prophesy which we haven't addressed. It states ""neither can live while the other survives."""
4608,156,41,4,"It is the final burden which I must place on you, Harry."
4609,156,41,1,One of us has to kill the other...in the end.
4610,156,41,4,Yes.
4611,156,36,47,"Hello, Harry."
4612,156,36,1,"Hey, Nick."
4613,156,36,47,"I--Well, Madam Pomfrey asked me to tell you that Hermione and Ron are out of the hospital wing."
4614,156,36,1,Oh. Thanks.
4615,156,36,1,"Nick, I was wondering about something?"
4616,156,36,47,I've been expecting this...
4617,156,36,1,Expecting what?
4618,156,36,47,A lot of people come to me when they've lost loved ones.
4619,156,36,1,I expect so...
4620,156,36,47,"He's not coming back, Harry."
4621,156,36,1,Why?
4622,156,36,47,I'm sorry I couldn't be of more
4623,156,36,3,Harry!
4624,156,36,1,How are you?
4625,156,36,2,"Good as new, mate."
4626,156,36,1,Better.
4627,156,36,3,"Come on, let's go in to the feast."
4628,156,36,1,I've got something to tell you. Something important.
4629,156,36,1,But not right now. I'm not ready.
4630,156,36,3,"Take your time, Harry. We'll be here when you are."
4631,156,36,25,"Hello, Harry."
4632,156,36,25,It's the last night and I need to pack.
4633,156,36,25,"Oh, people take my things and hide them."
4634,156,36,25,"I don't think they like me much. Some of them call me ""Loony"" Lovegood."
4635,156,36,1,Do you need any help looking?
4636,156,36,25,Oh no. It all turns up in the end.
4637,156,36,25,Sirius Black. Hermione said he was your Godfather.
4638,156,36,1,Yeah.
4639,156,36,25,My mother. I was nine.
4640,156,36,1,I'm sorry.
4641,156,36,25,It's okay. It's not like I'll never see her again.
4642,156,36,1,Isn't it?
4643,156,36,25,Don't tell me you didn't hear them. The voices beyond the Veil?
4644,156,36,25,"They were just out of sight, that's all."
4645,156,36,25,"Of course. Anyway, my mum always said the things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end. If not always in the way we expect. Think I'll just go have some pudding."
4646,157,36,1,I've been thinking about something Dumbledore said to me.
4647,157,36,3,What's that ?
4648,157,36,1,That even though we've got a fight ahead of us we've got one thing that Voldemort doesn't have.
4649,157,36,2,Yeah ?
4650,157,36,1,Something worth fighting for
4651,158,16,22,Narcissa!
4652,158,16,22,Cissy! You mustn't do this.  He can't be trusted.
4653,158,16,63,The Dark Lord trusts him.
4654,158,16,22,The Dark Lord is mistaken.
4655,158,16,22,Or so I believe.
4656,158,16,63,"Well, who can one trust these days?"
4657,158,16,22,He lives in this Muggle dunghill?
4658,158,16,6,"Run along, Wormtail."
4659,158,16,63,"I've nowhere else to turn, Severus."
4660,158,16,22,You must be joking.
4661,158,16,63,I know I ought not to be here. The Dark Lord himself has forbidden me to speak of this --
4662,158,16,6,"If the Dark Lord has forbidden it, you ought not to speak."
4663,158,16,6,"Put it down, Bella.  We mustn't touch what isn't ours. As it so happens I'm aware of your situation, Narcissa."
4664,158,16,22,You? The Dark Lord told you?
4665,158,16,6,"Your sister doubts me, Narcissa. Understandable."
4666,158,16,6,Over the years I have played my part well.  So well I've deceived one of the greatest wizards of all time.
4667,158,16,6,Dumbledore is a great wizard. Only a fool would question it.
4668,158,16,63,"I... I don't doubt you, Severus."
4669,158,16,22,"You should feel honored, Cissy. As should Draco --"
4670,158,16,63,He's just a boy!
4671,158,16,6,I can't change the Dark Lord's mind.  But it might be possible for me to help Draco.  To provide some... protection.
4672,158,16,63,"Do you mean it, Severus?"
4673,158,16,6,I can try.
4674,158,16,63,"Oh, Severus, please, if you would... I would be forever in your debt."
4675,158,16,22,Swear to it.
4676,158,16,22,Make the Unbreakable Vow. You see.  It's just empty words. Oh he'll try.  He'll give it his best effort.  But when it matters most he'll slither back into his hole.  Bloody coward...
4677,158,16,6,Take out your wand.
4678,158,16,22,"Will you, Severus Snape, watch over Draco Malfoy as he attempts to fulfill the Dark Lord's wishes."
4679,158,16,6,I will.
4680,158,16,22,"And will you, to the best of your ability, protect him from harm?"
4681,158,16,6,I will.
4682,158,16,22,"And should it prove necessary, if it seems Draco will fail... will you yourself carry out the deed that the Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform?"
4683,158,16,6,I will.
4684,159,11,143,Harry Potter.  Who's Harry Potter?
4685,159,11,1,Oh.  Um.  No one.  Bit of a tosser.
4686,159,11,143,"Funny that paper of yours.  Couple nights ago, I could swear I saw one of the pictures move."
4687,159,11,1,Really.
4688,159,11,143,Thought I'd gone round the twist.
4689,159,11,1,Hey.  I was wondering...
4690,159,11,143,Eleven.  That's when I get off.
4691,160,11,4,I once knew a Muggle girl from Liverpool with hair like spun silk.  No light could resist it...
4692,160,11,1,I like riding round on the trains. It takes my mind off... things.
4693,160,11,4,"Rather unpleasant to behold, isn't it?  The tale is thrilling if I do say so myself, but I'm afraid now is not the time to tell it.  Take my arm."
4694,160,18,1,"I just Apparated, didn't I?"
4695,160,18,4,Indeed.  And quite successfully I might add.  Most people vomit their first time.
4696,160,18,1,Can't imagine why...
4697,160,18,4,"Welcome to the charming village of Budleigh Babberton, Harry.  I assume right about now you're wondering why I've brought you here, am I right?"
4698,160,18,1,"After all these years, I just sort of roll with it, sir."
4699,160,18,4,"Wand out, Harry."
4700,160,18,4,Lumos...
4701,160,18,4,Horace!
4702,160,18,8,Merlin's Beard!
4703,160,18,8,"There's no need to disfigure me, Albus!"
4704,160,18,4,"I must say, you make a very convincing armchair, Horace."
4705,160,18,8,It's all in the upholstery. I come by the stuffing naturally. What gave me away?
4706,160,18,4,Dragon's blood.
4707,160,18,8,"Yes, well, I couldn't very well use wizard's blood, could I?  Oho!"
4708,160,18,4,"Ah yes.  Introductions.  Harry, this is an old friend and colleague of mine, Horace Slughorn.  Horace, this is, well, you know who this is. Apparently there's some thought he may be the Chosen One."
4709,160,18,4,"So why all the theatrics, Horace? You weren't perhaps expecting someone else, were you?"
4710,160,18,8,S-someone else?  I'm sure I don't know what you mean.
4711,160,18,8,Oh all right!  The Death Eaters have been trying to recruit me for over a year.  Do you know what that's like?  One can only say no to these people so many times before they...
4712,160,18,4,Take matters into their own hands?
4713,160,18,8,I never stay anywhere more than a week.  The Muggles who own this place are in the Canary Islands.
4714,160,18,4,"Well, I think it should be put back in order for them, don't you? Mind?"
4715,160,18,4,That was fun.  May I use the loo?
4716,160,18,8,"Don't think I don't know why you're here, Albus!  The answer is still no!  Absolutely, unequivocally no!"
4717,160,18,8,You look very like your father. Except for your eyes.  You've got --
4718,160,18,1,"My mother's eyes, yeah."
4719,160,18,8,Lily.  Lovely Lily.  She was exceedingly bright -- your mother. Even more impressive when one considers she was Muggle-born.
4720,160,18,1,One of my best friends is Muggle- born.  She's the best in our year.
4721,160,18,8,"Oh, but you mustn't think I'm prejudiced!  No, no, no! Your mother was one of my absolute favorites!  Look, there she is. Right up front."
4722,160,18,8,"All mine, each and every one.  Ex- students, I mean.  You recognize Barnubas Cuffe, of course, editor of the Daily Prophet."
4723,160,18,8,"Always takes my owl should I want to register my opinion on the news of the day.  And there's Ambrosius Flume of Honeydukes.  Sends a hamper of chocolate to the house each birthday.  That is, when I had a house.  And Gwenog Jones, captain of the Holyhead Harpies -- free tickets whenever I want them. Of course, I haven't been to a match in some time..."
4724,160,18,8,"Ah yes.  Regulus Black.  You no doubt know of his older brother Sirius.  Died a few weeks ago.  I taught the whole Black family except Sirius.  Shame.  Talented boy.  I got Regulus when he came along, of course, but I'd have liked the set."
4725,160,18,4,Mind if I take this?  I do love knitting patterns.
4726,160,18,8,Of course.  But you're not leaving?
4727,160,18,4,"I think I know a lost cause when I see one.  Regrettable.  I would have considered it a personal triumph had you consented to return to Hogwarts, Horace.  You are, like my friend Mr. Potter -- one of a kind."
4728,160,18,8,"All right!  I'll do it.  But I'll be wanting Professor Merrythought's old office, not that water closet I had formerly. And I expect a raise!  These are mad times we live in!  Mad!"
4729,160,18,4,Indeed they are.
4730,160,17,1,"Sir, exactly what was that all --"
4731,160,17,4,"You are talented, famous and powerful -- everything Horace values.  Professor Slughorn is going to try to collect you, Harry.  You would be his crowning jewel.  That is why he is returning to Hogwarts.  And it is crucial he return..."
4732,160,17,4,"I fear I may have stolen a wondrous night from you, Harry. She was, truthfully, very pretty. The girl."
4733,160,17,1,"It's alright, sir.  I'll go back tomorrow, make some excuse --"
4734,160,17,4,"You'll not be going back to Little Whinging tonight, Harry."
4735,160,17,1,"But, sir.  What about Hedwig?  And there's my trunk --"
4736,160,17,4,Both are waiting for you.
4737,160,17,1,Sir?
4738,161,17,20,Hedwig...?  Mum!
4739,161,17,20,Exactly.  How'd you guess?
4740,161,17,20,"I'm joking, Mum."
4741,161,17,26,You're worse than Fred and George.
4742,161,17,20,Now you're joking.  I was only wondering when Harry got here.
4743,161,17,26,Harry who?
4744,161,17,20,"Harry Dimpleton.  Harry Potter, of course."
4745,161,17,26,"I think I'd know if Harry Potter was in my house, wouldn't I?"
4746,161,17,20,Well his trunk's in the kitchen. And his owl.
4747,161,17,26,I seriously doubt that.
4748,161,17,2,Harry?  Did someone say Harry?
4749,161,17,20,"Me, nosy.  Is he up there with you?"
4750,161,17,2,"'Course not.  Think I'd know if my best friend was in my room, wouldn't I?"
4751,161,17,3,Was that an owl I heard?
4752,161,17,20,"Harry's.  Haven't seen him, have you?  Apparently, he's wandering about the house."
4753,161,17,3,Really?
4754,161,17,1,Really.
4755,161,17,2,Harry!
4756,161,17,3,Harry!
4757,161,17,26,But why didn't you tell us you were coming?
4758,161,17,1,Didn't know. Dumbledore.
4759,161,17,26,"That man.  But then, what would we do without him?  Ron!"
4760,161,17,2,You've a bit of...
4761,161,17,1,When'd you get here?
4762,161,17,3,"A few days ago.  Though... for a bit, I wasn't sure I was coming."
4763,161,17,2,Mum sort of lost it last week. Said Ginny and I had no business going back to Hogwarts.  That it's too dangerous.
4764,161,17,1,Oh come on...
4765,161,17,3,She's not alone.  Even my parents -- and they're Muggles -- know something bad is happening.
4766,161,17,2,"Anyway, Dad stepped in, told her she was being barmy.  Took a day or two, but she came round."
4767,161,17,1,But we're talking about Hogwarts. Dumbledore. What could be safer?
4768,161,17,3,There's been a lot of chatter lately.  That he's gotten... old.
4769,161,17,1,Rubbish.  He's only -- what?
4770,161,17,2,A hundred and fifty.  Give or take a few years.
4771,161,6,14,Step up!  Step up!
4772,161,6,19,Step up!  Step up!
4773,161,6,19,We've got Fainting Fancy...
4774,161,6,14,Nosebleed Nougats...
4775,161,6,19,And just in time for school...
4776,161,6,14,Puking Pastilles!
4777,161,6,14,"Into the cauldron, handsome."
4778,161,6,19,"Into the cauldron, handsome."
4779,161,6,14,"What'd you think, Harry?"
4780,161,6,1,Amazing.
4781,161,6,19,"Pocket that and you'll pay in more than Galleons, my friend."
4782,161,6,14,We've got eyes in the back of our heads.
4783,161,6,19,Bloody urchins.
4784,161,6,1,Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder?
4785,161,6,14,A real money spinner that.
4786,161,6,14,"Handy if you need to make a quick escape.  Hello, ladies!"
4787,161,6,19,"Yes, they do really work."
4788,161,6,14,"Then again, the way we hear it, sis, you're doing just fine on your own."
4789,161,6,20,Meaning?
4790,161,6,14,Are you not currently dating Dean Thomas?
4791,161,6,20,None of your business.
4792,161,6,3,These are adorable.
4793,161,6,14,Aren't they now.  Pygmy Puffs. Can't breed them fast enough.
4794,161,6,2,How much for this?
4795,161,6,14,Five Galleons.
4796,161,6,19,Five Galleons.
4797,161,6,2,How much for me?
4798,161,6,14,Five Galleons.
4799,161,6,19,Five Galleons.
4800,161,6,2,But I'm your brother!
4801,161,6,14,Ten Galleons.
4802,161,6,2,C'mon. Let's go.
4803,161,6,65,"Hi, Ron."
4804,161,6,2,Hi.
4805,161,6,3,How is it Fred and George are doing it?  Half the alley's closed down.
4806,161,6,2,Fred reckons people need a laugh these days.
4807,161,6,1,Reckon he's right...
4808,161,6,3,Oh no.  Look.
4809,161,6,3,But everyone got their wands from Ollivander.  Young.  Old...
4810,161,6,1,Good.  Bad.  Speaking of which...
4811,161,6,2,Is it just me?  Or do Draco and mummy look like two people who don't want to be followed?
4812,161,6,2,What're they playing at?
4813,161,6,1,Dunno.  Let's get closer.
4814,161,6,2,Hey.  Where's Hermione?
4815,161,6,2,"Harry, where is she?"
4816,161,6,1,I don't know.  I'm turned around.
4817,161,6,2,Bloody hell.
4818,161,6,3,Sorry.
4819,161,6,1,What just happened?
4820,161,6,3,I don't know.
4821,161,42,25,Quibbler...?  Quibbler...?
4822,161,42,25,There's an article on Wrackspurts this month.  Quibbler...?
4823,161,42,25,"He's lovely.  They've been known to sing on Boxing Day, you know. Quibbler?"
4824,161,42,20,Please.  What's a Wrackspurt?
4825,161,42,25,They're invisible creatures that float in through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy. Quibbler?  Quibbler?
4826,161,42,1,"Don't you see, it was a ceremony. An initiation."
4827,161,42,3,"Stop, Harry, I know where you're going with this --"
4828,161,42,1,It's happened.  He's one of them.
4829,161,42,2,One of what?
4830,161,42,3,Harry is under the impression that Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.
4831,161,42,2,You're barking.  What would You- Know-Who want with a sod like Malfoy?
4832,161,42,1,So what's he doing in Borgin and Burke's?  Browsing for furniture?
4833,161,42,2,It's a creepy shop.  He's a creepy bloke.
4834,161,42,1,"Look.  His father's a Death Eater. It only makes sense.  Besides, Hermione saw it.  With her own eyes."
4835,161,42,3,I told you.  I don't know what I saw.
4836,161,42,1,I need some air.
4837,162,42,12,What just happened?  Blaise?
4838,162,42,105,Don't know.
4839,162,42,91,"Relax, boys.  The lights went out is all.  Come, Draco.  We'll be at Hogwarts before you know it."
4840,162,42,12,Hogwarts.  What a pathetic excuse for a school.  I think I'd pitch myself off the Astronomy Tower if I thought I had to continue on for another two years.
4841,162,42,91,What's that supposed to mean?
4842,162,42,12,Let's just say I don't think you'll be seeing me wasting my time in Charms Class next year.
4843,162,42,12,"Amused, Blaise?  We'll see just who's laughing in the end."
4844,162,42,3,Where's Harry?
4845,162,42,2,Probably on the platform.  C'mon.
4846,162,42,12,You two go on.  I want to check something.
4847,162,42,12,"Didn't mummy ever tell you it's bad manners to eavesdrop, Potter? Petrificus Totalus!"
4848,162,42,12,"Oh, right, she was dead before you could wipe the drool off your chin."
4849,162,42,12,Enjoy the ride back to London.
4850,162,42,25,"Hello, Harry."
4851,162,42,1,Luna.  How'd you...?
4852,162,42,25,Wrackspurts. Your head's full of them.
4853,162,42,1,"Sorry I made you miss the carriages, Luna."
4854,162,42,25,It's alright.  I enjoyed our walk. It was like being with a friend.
4855,162,42,1,"I am your friend, Luna."
4856,162,42,25,That's nice.
4857,162,42,59,About time!  I've been looking all over for you two.  Names.
4858,162,42,1,"Professor Flitwick, you've known me for five years."
4859,162,42,59,"No exceptions, Potter."
4860,162,42,25,Who are those people?
4861,162,42,59,Aurors. For security.
4862,162,42,12,"It's a not a cane, you cretin. It's a walking stick."
4863,162,42,35,And what exactly would you be wanting with a walking stick?
4864,162,42,6,It was his father's.
4865,162,42,12,Is my father's.  He's not dead.
4866,162,42,6,"It's alright, Mr. Filch.  I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy."
4867,162,42,12,"Nice face, Potter."
4868,162,42,25,Would you like me to fix it? Personally I think you look a bit more devil-may-care this way.  But it's up to you.
4869,162,42,1,Have you ever fixed one?  A nose.
4870,162,42,25,No.  But I've done several toes and how different are they really?
4871,162,42,1,What the hell.  Give it a go.
4872,162,42,25,Episkey.
4873,162,42,1,Well?  How do I look?
4874,162,42,25,Exceptionally ordinary.
4875,162,42,1,Brilliant.
4876,163,36,2,Don' you worry.  He'll be 'long soon 'nuff --
4877,163,36,3,Will.  You.  Stop.  Eating!  Your best friend is missing!
4878,163,36,2,"Oi!  Turn around, you lunatic."
4879,163,36,20,He's covered in blood again.  Why is it he's always covered in blood?
4880,163,36,2,Looks like his own this time.
4881,163,36,3,"Where've you been, Harry?  And what happened to your face?"
4882,163,36,1,Later.  What've I missed?
4883,163,36,2,"Sorting Hat urged us all to be brave and strong in these troubled times -- easy for it to say -- it's a hat, isn't it?  First Years seemed to enjoy it, though. Wankers. Filch give you the wand outside?"
4884,163,36,1,Thanks...
4885,163,36,3,What's happened to his hand?
4886,163,36,4,"The very best of evenings to you! First off, please join me in welcoming the newest member of our staff, Horace Slughorn."
4887,163,36,4,"Professor Slughorn, I'm happy to say, has agreed to resume his old post of Potions master.  Meanwhile the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts will be assumed by Professor Snape."
4888,163,36,4,"Now, as you know, each and every one of you was searched upon your arrival tonight.  You have a right to know why."
4889,163,36,4,"Once there was a young man who, like you, sat in this very Hall. Walked this castle's corridors. Slept beneath its roof.  He seemed, to all the world, a student like any other.  His name? Tom Riddle. The Hall goes utterly silent."
4890,163,36,4,"Today, of course, the world knows him by another name.  Which is why, as I stand looking out upon you all tonight, I am reminded of a sobering fact.  Each day, every hour, this very minute perhaps, dark forces attempt to penetrate this castle.  But in the end, their greatest weapon remains... you."
4891,163,36,4,"Just something to keep in mind. Now, off to bed.  Pip pip!"
4892,163,36,2,That was cheerful.
4893,163,36,7,"History of Magic is up, ladies, not down.  Mr. Davies -- that's the girl's toilet..."
4894,163,36,7,Potter!
4895,163,36,1,This can't be good.
4896,163,36,7,"Enjoying ourself, are we?"
4897,163,36,1,"Well, you see, I've got an open period this morning, Professor --"
4898,163,36,7,So I noticed.  I would think you'd want to fill it with Potions.  Or is it no longer your ambition to become an Auror?
4899,163,36,1,It is.  Or was.  But I was told I had to get an Outstanding in my
4900,163,36,7,"And so you did when Professor Snape was teaching Potions. However, Professor Slughorn is perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T. students with 'Exceeds Expectations.'"
4901,163,36,1,Really?  Well... brilliant.  I'll head there straight away.
4902,163,36,7,Good.  And take Weasley with you. He looks far too happy over there.
4903,163,36,2,But I don't want to take Potions!
4904,164,49,8,Harry m'boy!  I was beginning to worry!  And I see we've brought someone with us...
4905,164,49,2,"Ron Weasley, sir.  But I'm dead awful at Potions, a menace actually, so I probably should just be going --"
4906,164,49,8,"Nonsense, we'll sort you out.  Any friend of Harry's is a friend of mine.  Right then, books out --"
4907,164,49,1,"Um, sorry, sir, but I haven't got my book yet -- nor's Ron.  You see --"
4908,164,49,8,Not to worry.  You can get what you need from the cupboard.
4909,164,49,8,"Now, as I was saying, I've prepared a few concoctions this morning.  Any ideas what these might be?  Yes, Miss...?"
4910,164,49,3,"Granger, sir.  That one there is Veritaserum.  And that would be Polyjuice Potion.  And that is Amortentia! The most powerful love potion in the world."
4911,164,49,3,"It's rumored to smell differently to each person, according to what attracts them.  For example, I smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and spearmint toothpaste --"
4912,164,49,8,One of my best friends is Muggle- born.  She's the best in our year...
4913,164,49,8,"Now Amortentia doesn't create actual love, of course.  That's impossible.  But it does cause a powerful infatuation or obsession. For that reason, it is probably the most dangerous potion in this room."
4914,164,49,94,"Sir, you haven't told us what's in that one."
4915,164,49,8,Ah yes...
4916,164,49,8,"What you see before you, ladies and gentlemen, is a curious little potion known as Felix Felicis. But it is more commonly referred to as --"
4917,164,49,3,Liquid luck.
4918,164,49,8,"Yes, Miss Granger.  Desperately tricky to make.  Disastrous should you get it wrong.  But brewed correctly, as this has been, it has remarkable powers.  One sip and you will find that all your endeavors succeed... at least until the effects wear off."
4919,164,49,94,But then why don't people drink it all the time?
4920,164,49,8,"Because taken in excess it causes giddiness, recklessness and dangerous overconfidence."
4921,164,49,105,"Have you ever taken it, sir?"
4922,164,49,8,Twice.  Once when I was twenty- four.  Once when I was fifty- seven.  Two tablespoons taken at breakfast.  Two perfect days...
4923,164,49,8,"So.  This is what I offer each of you today.  One tiny vial of liquid luck... to the student who, in the hour that remains, manages to brew an acceptable Draught of Living Death, the recipe for which can be found on page ten of your textbook."
4924,164,49,8,"You should know that in all the years of my previous tenure at Hogwarts, not once did a student brew a potion of sufficient quality to claim this prize.  In any event -- good luck."
4925,164,49,3,How did you do that?
4926,164,49,1,Crush it.  Don't cut it.
4927,164,49,3,No.  The instructions specifically say to cut.
4928,164,49,1,No.  Really --
4929,164,49,3,Sh!
4930,164,49,8,"Merlin's Beard!  But it's perfect. So perfect I daresay one sip would kill us all!  Your mother was a dab hand at potions, but this... My, my, what can't you do, m'boy? Perhaps you will save us all in the end..."
4931,164,49,8,"Here you are then, as promised. One bottle of Felix Felicis.  Use it well."
4932,165,41,4,"Good evening, Harry.  You got my message, I see.  Come, come.  Sit."
4933,165,41,4,So.  How are you?
4934,165,41,1,"Fine, sir."
4935,165,41,4,"Enjoying your classes?  Professor Slughorn, for one, is most impressed with you."
4936,165,41,1,"I think he overestimates my abilities, sir."
4937,165,41,4,Do you?
4938,165,41,1,Definitely.
4939,165,41,4,And what of your activities outside the classroom?  Do they bring you satisfaction?
4940,165,41,1,Sir?
4941,165,41,4,I notice you spend a great deal of time with Miss Granger.  One can't help but wonder if --
4942,165,41,1,No!  I mean... she's brilliant. And we're friends.  But... no.
4943,165,41,4,"Forgive me, Harry, I..."
4944,165,41,4,"... I was merely curious. In any event, I'm sure you're wondering why I've summoned you here tonight.  The answer lies here."
4945,165,41,4,What you see before you are memories.  In this case pertaining to one individual:  Voldemort.  Or as he was known then... Tom Riddle.
4946,165,41,4,This vial contains a most particular memory -- of the day I first met him.  I'd like you to see it.  If you would...
4947,165,48,90,"I must confess to a bit of confusion upon receiving your letter, Mr. Dumbledore.  In all the years Tom's been here, he's never once had a family visitor. Frankly, I was stunned to find that someone knew of his existence."
4948,165,48,4,I am not family.  But his name has been known to me since birth.
4949,165,48,90,I see...
4950,165,48,90,I think I should tell you.  He's a funny boy -- Tom.  Odd.  There have been incidents with the other children.  Nasty things.
4951,165,48,4,Perhaps you could give me an example.
4952,165,48,90,"You've got a visitor, Tom."
4953,165,48,4,"How do you do, Tom."
4954,165,48,90,"Well, I'll leave you two to yourselves."
4955,165,48,24,Don't.
4956,165,48,4,As you wish.
4957,165,48,24,"You're the doctor, aren't you?"
4958,165,48,4,No.  I am a Professor.
4959,165,48,24,"I don't believe you.  I hear Mrs. Cole talking, her and the rest of the staff.  They want me looked at.  They think I'm different."
4960,165,48,4,Perhaps they're right.
4961,165,48,24,I'm not mad.
4962,165,48,4,Hogwarts is not a place for mad people.
4963,165,48,4,It's a school.  A school of... magic.
4964,165,48,4,"You can do things, can't you, Tom? Things the other children can't."
4965,165,48,24,Yes.
4966,165,48,4,"Tell me some of the things you can do, Tom."
4967,165,48,24,I can make things move -- without touching them.  I can make animals do what I want without training them.  I can make bad things happen to people who are mean to me.  I can make them hurt... if I want.
4968,165,48,24,Who are you?
4969,165,48,4,"I'm like you, Tom.  Different."
4970,165,48,24,Prove it.
4971,165,48,4,"I think there is something trying to get out of your wardrobe, Tom. Open it.  Open.  It."
4972,165,48,4,Take it out.
4973,165,48,4,Is there anything in that box you ought not to have?
4974,165,48,4,"Why did you want these things, Tom?"
4975,165,48,24,I like having things that belonged to other people.  It makes me feel ... close to them.
4976,165,48,4,"Thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts.  At Hogwarts, you will be taught not only how to use magic, but to control it. Understood? I'll be going now, Tom.  Leave your window open tonight.  An owl will bring you a message.  Read it carefully."
4977,165,48,24,I can speak to snakes too.
4978,165,48,24,They find me.  Whisper things.  Is that normal.  For someone like me?
4979,165,48,4,It is unusual.  But not unheard of.
4980,165,41,1,"Did you know, sir?  Then?"
4981,165,41,4,Did I know that I had just met the most dangerous Dark Wizard of all time?  No.  Had I...
4982,165,41,4,"Over time, while here at Hogwarts, Tom Riddle grew close to one particular teacher.  Can you guess which teacher that might be?"
4983,165,41,1,"You didn't bring Professor Slughorn back simply to teach Potions, did you, sir?"
4984,165,41,4,"No.  I did not.  You see, Professor Slughorn possesses something I desire very dearly. And he will not part with it easily... I'd rather not divulge any more just yet, Harry.  But I promise. In time you will know everything."
4985,165,41,1,You said Professor Slughorn would try to collect me.
4986,165,41,4,I did.
4987,165,41,1,Do you want me to let him?
4988,165,41,4,Yes.
4989,166,51,1,All right!  Queue up!  Excuse me...
4990,166,51,20,Shut It!
4991,166,51,1,Thanks.  All right.  This morning I'll be putting you all through a few drills to assess your strengths.  But know this:  Just because you made the team last year does not guarantee you a spot this year.  Is that clear?
4992,166,51,71,"No hard feelings, Weasley, alright?"
4993,166,51,2,Hard feelings?
4994,166,51,71,I'll be going out for Keeper as well.  Nothing personal.
4995,166,51,2,"Really?  Strapping guy like you, you've got a Beater's build, don't you think?  Keeper needs to be agile, quick --"
4996,166,51,71,"I like my chances.  Say... think you could introduce me to your friend Granger?  Wouldn't mind getting on a first name basis, know what I mean?"
4997,166,51,1,"All right.  Cormac.  Ron.  It's down to you two for Keeper.  We'll decide it with a shootout. Demelza, you'll bring the Quaffle up against Cormac.  Ginny, you'll take on Ron."
4998,166,51,71,Hang on.  She's his sister.  How do I know she won't toss him a floater?
4999,166,51,20,"Piss off, Cormac.  How 'bout I toss you a floater?"
5000,166,51,1,Quiet!  I'm Captain.  We do it my way.  Now line up.  On three. One.  Two... Three!
5001,166,51,1,"C'mon, Ron..."
5002,166,51,65,Isn't he brilliant?
5003,166,39,2,"Have to admit, thought I was going to miss that last one.  Hope Cormac's not taking it too hard."
5004,166,39,2,"Has a bit of a thing for you, Hermione.  Cormac."
5005,166,39,3,He's vile.
5006,166,39,1,Ever heard of this spell?
5007,166,39,3,No I have not. And if you had a shred of self-respect you would turn that book in.
5008,166,39,2,"Not bloody likely.  He's top of the class.  Even better than you, Hermione.  Slughorn thinks he's a genius."
5009,166,39,2,What?
5010,166,39,3,"I'd like to know just whose book that was.  Let's take a look, shall we?"
5011,166,39,1,No.
5012,166,39,3,Why not?
5013,166,39,1,It's... old.  The binding is fragile.
5014,166,39,3,The binding is fragile?
5015,166,39,20,Who's the Half-Blood Prince?
5016,166,39,3,The who?
5017,166,39,2,The who?
5018,166,39,20,That's what it says.  Right here. 'This Book is the Property of the Half-Blood Prince.'
5019,166,39,3,"For weeks you carry around this book, practically sleep with it... and you have no desire to find out who The Half-Blood Prince is?"
5020,166,39,1,"I didn't say I wasn't curious. And, by the way, I don't sleep with it."
5021,166,22,2,"Yeah. Right. Well, it's true.  I like a nice chat before I go to bed.  Now you're always reading that bloody book.  It's like being with Hermione."
5022,166,22,3,"Well, I was curious.  So I went to"
5023,166,22,1,The library.
5024,166,22,2,The library.
5025,166,22,1,And?
5026,166,22,3,And... nothing.  There's no reference to the Half-Blood Prince anywhere.
5027,166,22,1,Good.  That settles it then.
5028,167,22,5,"Hey, you three!"
5029,167,22,3,"What've you got there, Hagrid?"
5030,167,22,5,Stinksap.  Burn the whiskers right off yer chin.  Trees 'ere are drippin' with it.
5031,167,22,3,"Stinksap?  You're not sick, are you?"
5032,167,22,5,"It's not fer me.  It's fer Aragog. Yeh remember Aragog, don' yeh?"
5033,167,22,2,Spider?  About six feet tall?  Ten feet wide?
5034,167,22,5,Tha's the one.  He's taken ill. I'm hopin' ter nurse 'im back. Keep yer fingers crossed.
5035,167,22,2,Barking.  Does he not remember that raving arachnid tried to eat us? What?
5036,167,22,3,"The Aurors. I know they're here to protect us, but... somehow I don't feel any safer."
5037,167,22,8,Filius!  I was hoping to find you at the Three Broomsticks.
5038,167,22,59,"Emergency choir practice, I'm afraid, Horace."
5039,167,22,1,Who's up for a Butterbeer?
5040,167,22,1,No.  Over here.
5041,167,22,1,"No, no.  Sit next to me."
5042,167,22,2,O-kay.
5043,167,22,157,What'll we have?
5044,167,22,3,"Three Butterbeers.  Splash of ginger in mine, please."
5045,167,22,2,"Aw, bloody hell..."
5046,167,22,3,"Oh, honestly, Ronald.  They're just holding hands..."
5047,167,22,3,And snogging.
5048,167,22,2,I'd like to leave.
5049,167,22,3,Leave?  You can't be serious.
5050,167,22,2,That happens to be my sister.
5051,167,22,3,So?  What if she looked over here and saw you snogging me?  Would you expect her to get up and leave?
5052,167,22,8,"Harry, m'boy!"
5053,167,22,1,"Hello, sir.  Wonderful to see you."
5054,167,22,1,"So what brings you here, sir?"
5055,167,22,8,"Oh, the Three Broomsticks and I go way back.  Longer than I'd care to admit.  In fact, I remember when it was simply One Broomstick!"
5056,167,22,8,"Oops!  All hands on deck, Granger!"
5057,167,22,8,"Listen, m'boy.  In the old days, I used to throw together the occasional supper and invite a select student or two.  Would you be game?"
5058,167,22,1,"I'd consider it an honor, sir."
5059,167,22,8,"You'd be welcome too, Granger."
5060,167,22,3,"Be delighted, sir."
5061,167,22,8,"Brilliant.  Look for my owl. Good to see you, Wallenby."
5062,167,22,2,What're you playing at?
5063,167,22,1,Dumbledore asked me to... get to know him.
5064,167,22,2,Get to know him?
5065,167,22,1,Dunno.  But it must be important. Otherwise Dumbledore wouldn't ask.
5066,167,22,2,Um... You've got a little...
5067,167,22,2,Bit worried about her.  Did you hear that rubbish she was talking back in the pub?  Her and me snogging.  Ha.  As if...
5068,167,22,100,Katie.  You don't know what it could be!
5069,167,22,3,What's up?
5070,167,22,100,I warned her!  I warned her not to touch it!
5071,167,22,2,"Harry, she's swallowing her tongue --"
5072,167,22,3,I'll get someone --
5073,167,22,1,There's no time!
5074,167,22,5,Get back!  All o' yeh!
5075,167,22,5,"Now, now.  Now, now..."
5076,167,22,5,Don' go touchin' tha' but by the wrappin's.  Unnerstan'?
5077,167,61,7,"You're sure Katie did not have this in her possession when she entered the Three Broomsticks, Leanne?"
5078,167,61,100,It's like I said.  She went to the loo and when she came back she had the package.  She said it was important she deliver it.
5079,167,61,7,Did she say to whom?
5080,167,61,7,"All right, Leanne.  You may go. Why is it always you three?  Hm? When something happens?"
5081,167,61,2,"Believe me, Professor, I've been asking myself the same question for six years."
5082,167,61,7,Severus. Is this it?
5083,167,61,6,What do you think?
5084,167,61,6,I think Miss Bell is lucky to be alive.
5085,167,61,1,"She was cursed, wasn't she?  I know Katie.  Off the Quidditch pitch she wouldn't hurt a fly.  If she was bringing that to someone, she wasn't doing it knowingly."
5086,167,61,7,Yes.  She was cursed.
5087,167,61,1,It was Malfoy.
5088,167,61,7,"That's a very serious accusation, Potter."
5089,167,61,6,Indeed.  Your evidence?
5090,167,61,1,I... just... know.
5091,167,61,6,"You... just... know.  Once again you astonish with your gifts, Potter, gifts mere mortals could only dream of possessing.  How grand it must be to be the Chosen One."
5092,167,61,7,I suggest you return to your dormitory.  All of you.
5093,167,39,2,What do you suppose Dean sees in her?  Ginny.
5094,167,39,1,What does she see in him?
5095,167,39,2,Dean?  He's brilliant.
5096,167,39,1,You called him a slick git not five hours ago.
5097,167,39,2,"Yeah, well, he was running his hands all over my sister, wasn't he?  Something snaps.  You've got to hate him.  You know, on principle."
5098,167,39,1,I suppose.
5099,167,39,2,So what is it?  He sees in her?
5100,167,39,1,I don't know.  She's smart. Funny.  Attractive...
5101,167,39,2,Attractive?
5102,167,39,1,You know.  She's... got nice skin.
5103,167,39,2,Skin?  You're saying Dean's dating my sister because of her skin?
5104,167,39,1,"Well, no.  I mean... I'm just saying it could be a contributing factor."
5105,167,39,2,"Hermione's got nice skin. Wouldn't you say?  As skin goes, I mean."
5106,167,39,1,"I've never really thought about it.  But I suppose, yeah.  Very nice."
5107,167,39,1,I think I'll be going to sleep now.
5108,167,39,2,Right.
5109,168,49,8,To Hogwarts' best and brightest!
5110,168,49,71,"Here, here!"
5111,168,49,10,Which one do I use for the soup?
5112,168,49,8,"So tell me, Cormac.  See much of your Uncle Tiberius these days?"
5113,168,49,71,"Yes, sir.  In fact, I'm meant to go hunting with him and the Minister for Magic over holiday."
5114,168,49,8,"Well, be sure to give them both my best.  What about your uncle, Belby?  Working on anything new? For those of you who don't know, Marcus' uncle invented the Wolfsbane Potion."
5115,168,49,124,Dunno.  He and me dad don't get on. Probably because Dad thinks potions are rubbish.  Says the only potion worth having is a stiff one at the end of the --
5116,168,49,8,"And you, Miss Granger?  What is it your family does in the Muggle world?"
5117,168,49,3,My parents are dentists.  They tend to people's teeth.
5118,168,49,8,Fascinating.  And is that considered a dangerous profession?
5119,168,49,3,"No.  Though, a boy named Robbie Fenwick did bite my father once. Needed ten stitches."
5120,168,49,8,"Miss Weasley!  Come in, come in."
5121,168,49,20,"Sorry, I'm not ordinarily late --"
5122,168,49,8,No matter.  You'll be just in time for dessert.  That is -- if Belby leaves you any.
5123,168,49,3,Look at her eyes.  They've been fighting again.  Her and Dean.
5124,168,49,1,What?
5125,168,49,3,Nothing.
5126,168,49,8,"Thank you, one and all, for a most stimulating evening.  We'll have to do it again."
5127,168,49,8,Oh.  Potter.
5128,168,49,1,"Sorry, sir, I was just admiring your hourglass."
5129,168,49,8,"Ah, yes.  A most intriguing object.  The sands run in accordance to the quality of the conversation.  When it is stimulating, the sands run slow. When it is not..."
5130,168,49,1,I think I'll be going.
5131,168,49,8,"Nonsense.  You have nothing to fear, m'boy.  As for some of your classmates, well, let's just say, they're unlikely to make the shelf."
5132,168,49,1,"The shelf, sir?"
5133,168,49,8,"Anyone who aspires to be anyone hopes to end up here.  Then again... you are already someone aren't you, Harry?"
5134,168,49,1,"I don't really know how to answer that, sir."
5135,168,49,8,"Your mother was modest too.  Your father not so much.  As you can see, he did not make the shelf."
5136,168,49,1,"Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir?"
5137,168,49,1,"You knew him, didn't you, sir? Tom Riddle.  You were his teacher."
5138,168,49,8,Mr. Riddle had many teachers while here at Hogwarts.
5139,168,49,1,What was he like?
5140,168,49,1,"I'm sorry, sir.  Forgive me.  He killed my parents, you see..."
5141,168,49,8,"Of course.  It's only natural that you should want to know more.  I'm afraid I must disappoint you, Harry.  When I first met young Mr. Riddle, he was simply a quiet, albeit brilliant, boy committed to becoming a first-rate wizard.  Not unlike the others I've known.  In fact, not unlike... you.  If the monster existed, it was buried deep within."
5142,169,36,10,"Good luck, eh, Ron?"
5143,169,36,29,"Counting on you, Ron.  I've two Galleons on Gryffindor."
5144,169,36,2,So.  How was it?
5145,169,36,3,How was what?
5146,169,36,2,Your dinner party.
5147,169,36,3,Dead boring.  Though I think Harry enjoyed dessert.
5148,169,36,3,"Ol' Sluggy's having a Christmas do, you know.  And we're meant to bring someone..."
5149,169,36,2,I expect you'll be going with McLaggen.  Isn't he a member of the Slug Club?
5150,169,36,3,"Actually, I was going to ask you."
5151,169,36,2,Really?
5152,169,36,3,Really.  But seeing as you have such a distaste for the idea --
5153,169,36,65,"Good luck today, Ron!  I know you'll be brilliant!"
5154,169,36,2,I'm resigning.  After today's match.  McLaggen can have my spot.
5155,169,36,1,Have it your way.  Juice?
5156,169,36,2,Sure...
5157,169,36,25,"Hello, everyone.  You look dreadful, Ron."
5158,169,36,25,Is that why you just put something in his cup.  Is it a tonic?
5159,169,36,3,"Don't drink that, Ron!"
5160,169,36,3,You could be expelled for that.
5161,169,36,1,Dunno what you're talking about.
5162,169,36,2,"C'mon, Harry.  We've got a game to win."
5163,169,51,20,What's gotten into him?
5164,169,51,75,Ginny!  Let's go!
5165,169,39,127,Weasley!  Weasley!  Weasley!
5166,169,39,3,Ron seems to be enjoying himself.
5167,169,39,1,Yep.  Apparently it's his lucky day.
5168,169,39,3,"You shouldn't have done it, Harry."
5169,169,39,1,"Yeah.  I suppose I could've just used, I dunno... a Confundus charm?"
5170,169,39,3,That was different.  It was tryouts.  This was an actual match --
5171,169,39,3,You didn't put it in? Ron only thought you did?
5172,170,39,3,Charms spell.  Just practicing.
5173,170,39,1,Ah.  Well... they're really good.
5174,170,39,3,"How does it feel, Harry?  When you see Dean with Ginny? I know, Harry.  You're my best friend.  I see how you look at her."
5175,170,39,65,Oops.  I think this room's taken.
5176,170,39,2,What's with the birds?
5177,170,39,3,Oppugno!
5178,170,39,1,It feels like this.
5179,170,39,2,"Look, I can't help it if she's got her knickers in a twist.  What Lav and I have -- well, let's just say there was no stopping it.  It's chemical.  Will it last?  Who knows?  Point is, I'm a free agent."
5180,170,44,3,"He's at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes.  I really couldn't care less.  Was I under the impression that he and I would be attending Slughorn's Christmas party together?  Yes.  Of course, now, given the circumstances, I've had to make other arrangements."
5181,170,44,1,Have you?
5182,170,44,3,Yes.  Why?
5183,170,44,1,"I just thought, you know, since neither one of us can take who we'd really like... maybe we'd go together.  As friends."
5184,170,44,3,Why didn't I think of that?
5185,170,44,1,So who are you taking?
5186,170,44,3,"Um... it's a surprise.  Besides, it's you we need to worry about. And you can't pick just anyone. See that girl over there.  That's Romilda Vane.  Rumor has it she's trying to slip you a love potion."
5187,170,44,1,Really...?
5188,170,44,3,"Hey! She's only interested in you because she thinks you're the Chosen One.  You know that, right?"
5189,170,44,1,But I am the Chosen One.
5190,170,44,1,Okay.  Kidding.  I'll just ask someone I like.  Someone cool.
5191,171,49,25,"I've never been to this part of the castle.  At least not while awake.  I sleepwalk, you see. It's why I wear shoes to bed."
5192,171,49,8,"Someone has taken a BITE out of it. Thank you, Adrian! One of mine.  Class of '78.  I had hoped for more out of him, but at least the pictures are in focus. Oh my!  Excuse me, Harry.  I must greet the new Minister of Magical Transportation.  Class of '67. Mingle, m'boy!  Mingle!  We're all friends here.  And we run the world."
5193,171,49,10,Drink?
5194,171,49,1,Neville...?
5195,171,49,10,I didn't make the cut for the Slug Club.  It's okay.  He's got Belby handing out towels in the loo.
5196,171,49,123,"Lovegood, did you say?  I once encountered a seriously unbalanced man by that name at a book signing.  Claimed to run a magazine..."
5197,171,49,1,What're you doing?
5198,171,49,1,And what's happened to you?
5199,171,49,3,"Hm?  Oh, I've just escaped -- I mean, left Cormac.  Under the mistletoe."
5200,171,49,1,Cormac!  That's who you invited!
5201,171,49,3,I thought it would annoy Ron most. But he's a menace.  He's got more tentacles than a Snarfalump plant.
5202,171,49,153,Dragon tartar?
5203,171,49,3,No thank you.
5204,171,49,153,Just as well.  They give one horribly bad breath.
5205,171,49,3,"On second thought -- maybe it'll keep Cormac at bay.  Oh no, here he comes!"
5206,171,49,1,I think she went to powder her nose.
5207,171,49,71,"Slippery little minx, your friend. Likes to work her mouth too, doesn't she?  Yak yak yak. What is this I'm eating, by the way?"
5208,171,49,1,Dragon balls.
5209,171,49,6,What's going on back here?
5210,171,49,6,"You've just bought yourself a month's detention, McLaggen."
5211,171,49,6,"Not so quick, Potter."
5212,171,49,1,"I think I should rejoin the party, sir.  My date..."
5213,171,49,6,... can surely survive your absence for another minute or two.
5214,171,49,6,"Besides, I only wish to convey a message."
5215,171,49,1,A message...?
5216,171,49,6,"From Professor Dumbledore.  He asked that I give you his best and that he hopes you enjoy your holiday.  You see, he's traveling and won't return until term resumes."
5217,171,49,1,Traveling?  Where?
5218,171,49,12,"Take your hands off me,  you filthy squib!"
5219,171,49,35,"Professor Slughorn, sir!  I've just discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor.  He claims to have been invited to your party."
5220,171,49,12,"Okay, okay, I was gate-crashing. Happy?"
5221,171,49,6,I'll escort him out.
5222,171,49,12,Certainly... Professor.
5223,171,49,12,Maybe I did hex that Bell girl. Maybe I didn't.  What's it to you?
5224,171,49,6,I swore to protect you.  I made the Unbreakable Vow --
5225,171,49,12,I don't need protection.  I was chosen for this!  Out of all others.  Me!  And I won't fail him.
5226,171,49,6,"You're afraid, Draco.  You attempt to conceal it, but it's obvious. Let me assist you --"
5227,171,49,12,No!  I was chosen.  This is my moment!
5228,172,42,2,Unbreakable Vow.  You're sure that's what Snape said.
5229,172,42,1,Positive.  Why?
5230,172,42,2,"It's just, well, you can't break an Unbreakable Vow."
5231,172,42,1,"I'd worked that much out for myself, funnily enough."
5232,172,42,2,"No, you don't understand -- Oh, bloody hell..."
5233,172,42,1,Lovely.
5234,172,42,2,All she wants to do is snog me. My lips are getting chapped. Look.
5235,172,42,1,I'll take your word for it.
5236,172,42,1,So what happens?  If you break an Unbreakable Vow?
5237,172,42,2,You die.
5238,173,7,26,"Eat up, eat up, everyone!  There's more to come!"
5239,173,7,1,"Draco's plotting something, I know it, something to do with Voldemort.  He's been given a task or a mission -- and Snape was offering to help."
5240,173,7,11,Voldemort has chosen Draco Malfoy for a mission?
5241,173,7,1,I know it sounds mad --
5242,173,7,11,"Has it occurred to you, Harry, that Snape was simply pretending to offer Draco help so that he could find out what he's up to?"
5243,173,7,1,That's not what it sounded like.
5244,173,7,61,"Perhaps Harry's right, Remus.  To make an Unbreakable Vow, after all --"
5245,173,7,11,"It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledore's judgement. He trusts Snape.  Therefore, I do."
5246,173,7,1,But Dumbledore can make mistakes. He's said it himself --
5247,173,7,11,You're blinded by hatred.
5248,173,7,1,I'm not --
5249,173,7,11,"You are!  People are disappearing, Harry.  Daily.  We can only put our trust in a handful of people. If we start fighting amongst ourselves, we're doomed."
5250,173,7,20,"Open up, you."
5251,173,7,20,Don't trust me?
5252,173,7,1,It's good.
5253,173,7,20,'Course 'tis.  Made them myself.
5254,173,7,16,You'll have to forgive Remus.  It takes its toll -- his condition.
5255,173,7,1,"Are you alright, Mr. Weasley?"
5256,173,7,16,"We're being followed, all of us. Molly doesn't leave the house most days.  It's not been easy."
5257,173,7,1,Did you get my owl?
5258,173,7,16,"Yes, but I thought it best if I replied in person.  If Dumbledore's traveling, it's news to the Ministry.  But perhaps that's the way Dumbledore wants it.  As for Draco Malfoy -- I know a bit more."
5259,173,7,1,Go on.
5260,173,7,16,"I sent an agent to Borgin & Burkes.  From what you describe, I think what you and Ron saw at the end of the summer -- the object that Draco seemed so interested in -- was a Vanishing Cabinet."
5261,173,7,1,A Vanishing Cabinet?
5262,173,7,16,"They were all the rage when Voldemort first rose to power. You can imagine the appeal. Should the Death Eaters come calling, one needed only slip inside and disappear for an hour or two.  But they're tricky contraptions.  Require a tremendous amount of looking after.  Eventually they fell out of favor."
5263,173,7,1,What happened to it?  The one at Borgin & Burkes?
5264,173,7,16,Nothing.  It's still there.
5265,173,7,16,"Harry.  You know, I went through all this before -- the last time around.  Times like these -- dark times -- do funny things to people.  It can bring them together and it can tear them apart.  Things... speed up.  It's what happens when you don't know if today will be your last."
5266,173,7,61,"It was delicious, Molly.  Really."
5267,173,7,26,You're sure you won't stay?
5268,173,7,61,"No, we should go. The first night of the cycle is always the worst --"
5269,173,7,26,Remus...?
5270,173,7,20,Everyone gone to bed?
5271,173,7,1,Soon.
5272,173,7,20,"I don't sleep these days.  So I wash my hair.  Silly, right?"
5273,173,7,20,"Happy Christmas, Harry."
5274,173,7,61,Sweetheart...
5275,173,7,11,There's someone out there.  I can smell him.  There's more than one --
5276,173,7,20,Oh my god...
5277,173,7,16,"Harry, no!"
5278,173,7,61,Remus!
5279,173,7,16,"Ginny, stay with your mother!"
5280,173,7,20,"No, Harry!  It's a trap!"
5281,173,7,102,Don't you smell clean.
5282,173,45,3,"You have to realize who you are, Harry."
5283,173,45,1,"I know who I am, Hermione, alright?"
5284,173,45,3,Sorry. So tell me what Arthur said.
5285,173,45,1,"If Dumbledore's traveling places, it's news to the Ministry.  But get this:  that night at Borgin & Burkes?  It seems Draco was looking at a Vanishing Cabinet."
5286,173,45,3,What would Draco want with a Vanishing Cabinet?
5287,173,45,1,You tell me.
5288,173,45,3,"He looks different, don't you think?  Draco.  Almost... ill."
5289,173,45,1,Who could tell the difference?
5290,173,45,2,"Lav, c'mon. Of course I'll wear it."
5291,173,45,65,That's my Won-Won.
5292,173,45,3,"Excuse me, I have to go vomit."
5293,174,48,24,"Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?"
5294,174,48,8,"Now, Tom, I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I?  I must say, m'boy, I'd like to know where you get your information.  More knowledgeable than half the staff, you are. By the way, thank you for the pineapple -- you're quite right, it is my favorite -- how is it you knew?"
5295,174,48,24,Intuition.
5296,174,48,8,"Good gracious, look at the time. Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippett will have us all in detention.  Lestrange, Avery, don't forget your essays..."
5297,174,48,8,"Look sharp, Tom.  You don't want to be caught out of bed after hours..."
5298,174,48,24,I know a secret shortcut or two.
5299,174,48,8,"Yes, I imagine you do.  Something on your mind, Tom?"
5300,174,48,24,"Yes, sir.  I couldn't think of anyone else to go to.  The other professors, well, they're not like you.  They might... misunderstand."
5301,174,48,8,Go on.
5302,174,48,24,"I was in the library the other night, in the Restricted section, and I read something rather odd, about a bit of rare magic, and I thought perhaps you could illuminate me..."
5303,174,48,8,I don't know anything about such things and I wouldn't tell you if I did!  Now get out of here at once and don't ever let me catch you mentioning it again!
5304,174,41,4,Confused?  I would be surprised if you weren't.
5305,174,41,1,I don't understand -- what happened?
5306,174,41,4,"This is perhaps the most important memory I've collected.  It's also a lie. This memory has been tampered with.  In this case by the person whose memory it is, our friend Professor Slughorn."
5307,174,41,1,But why would he tamper with his own memory?
5308,174,41,4,I suspect he is ashamed of it.
5309,174,41,1,Why?
5310,174,41,4,Why indeed.
5311,174,41,4,I asked you to get to know Professor Slughorn and you've done so.
5312,174,41,4,Now I want you to persuade him to divulge his true memory.  Any way you can.
5313,174,41,1,"I don't know him that well, sir --"
5314,174,41,4,"You're the Chosen One, Harry.  And Horace is, at heart, a decent man. Provide the proper circumstances and he will confess his sins."
5315,174,41,4,"This memory is everything, Harry. Without it, we are blind. Without it, we leave the fate of our world to chance.  You have no choice. You must not fail."
5316,175,49,8,"Now don't forget to look over the chapter on antidotes.  I'll be poisoning one of you next time we meet.  I'm joking!  Off you go! Don't forget your rattails, Miss Alys."
5317,175,49,8,Ah! If it isn't the Prince of Potions himself!  To what do I owe the pleasure?
5318,175,49,1,"Well, sir, I wondered if I might ask you something."
5319,175,49,8,"Ask away, my dear boy, ask away!"
5320,175,49,1,"Well, you see, the other day I was in the Restricted Section -- in the library -- and I stumbled upon something rather odd while reading.  Something about a bit of rare magic..."
5321,175,49,8,Yes?  And exactly what was this rare magic.
5322,175,49,1,"I'm not sure... That is, I don't recall the name... exactly.  But it got me wondering... Are there some kinds of magic you're not allowed to teach?"
5323,175,49,8,"I'm a Potions Professor, Harry. Perhaps your question would best be posed to Professor Snape."
5324,175,49,1,"Yes, well, we don't exactly see eye-to-eye, sir.  What I mean to say is, he's not like you.  He might... misunderstand."
5325,175,49,8,"There can be no light without the dark.  And so it is with magic. Myself, I have always strived to live within the light.  I suggest you do the same."
5326,175,49,1,"Did you say the same to Tom Riddle, sir?  When he came asking questions."
5327,175,49,8,Dumbledore put you up to this. Didn't he?  Didn't he!
5328,175,49,1,Sir --
5329,175,39,3,"Dead. Did you actually expect you could just walk up to Ol' Sluggy and ask him to reveal his deepest, darkest secret?  Honestly, Harry, sometimes I think the Daily Prophet should call you the Dim One."
5330,175,39,1,Nice.
5331,175,39,3,"You're going to have to persuade him somehow.  And now, I'm afraid, you've made it a lot harder."
5332,175,39,1,Hermione.  I think Malfoy's leaving the castle.
5333,175,39,1,I've seen it.  Sometimes... sometimes he just disappears off the Map.
5334,175,39,3,That's... not possible.  No one can leave the castle these days. The Map is wrong.
5335,175,39,1,The Map is never wrong.
5336,175,39,2,"It's beautiful, isn't it?  The moon."
5337,175,39,1,"Divine.  Had ourselves a little late-night snack, did we?"
5338,175,39,2,It was on your bed.  The box. Thought I'd try one...
5339,175,39,1,Or twenty.
5340,175,39,2,"I can't stop thinking about her, Harry."
5341,175,39,1,"Really?  Honestly, I reckoned she was starting to annoy you."
5342,175,39,2,She could never annoy me.  I think... I think I love her.
5343,175,39,1,Excuse me?
5344,175,39,1,Well... Brilliant.
5345,175,39,2,Do you think she knows I exist?
5346,175,39,1,Bloody well hope so.  She's been snogging you for three months.
5347,175,39,2,Snogging?  Who're you talking about?
5348,175,39,1,Who're you talking about?
5349,175,39,2,"Romilda, of course.  Romilda Vane."
5350,175,39,1,Okay.  Very funny.
5351,175,39,1,What the hell was that for?
5352,175,39,2,It's no joke!  I'm in love with her!
5353,175,39,1,Okay!  Fine!  You're in love with her!  Have you ever actually met her!
5354,175,39,2,No.  Can you introduce me?
5355,175,39,1,"Ron, these chocolates, they're -- C'mon.  I'm going to introduce you to Romilda Vane."
5356,175,49,2,How do I look?
5357,175,49,1,Devastatingly handsome.
5358,175,49,8,Damn it all!
5359,175,49,8,Yes???!!!! Oh.  Potter.  It's you.  I'm afraid I'm busy at the moment --
5360,175,49,1,Sir.  I'm sorry.  I wouldn't bother you if it weren't absolutely --
5361,175,49,2,Where's Romilda?
5362,175,49,8,What's the matter with Wenby?
5363,175,49,8,Ah.  Very well.  Bring him in.
5364,175,49,8,"I'd have thought you could whip up a remedy for this in no time, Harry -- an expert potioneer like you."
5365,175,49,1,"I figured this called for a more practiced hand, sir."
5366,175,49,2,"Hello, darling.  Fancy a drink?"
5367,175,49,8,Hm.  Perhaps you're right.
5368,175,49,1,"I'm sorry, sir.  About the other day.  Our... misunderstanding."
5369,175,49,8,"Yes, well, water under the bridge as they say, correct?"
5370,175,49,1,"I mean, I'm sure you're tired of it, after all these years.  The questions.  About... Voldemort."
5371,175,49,8,I'll ask you not to use that name.
5372,175,49,1,"Yes, sir.  It's just, well, Dumbledore once said that fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.  It seemed sensible."
5373,175,49,8,"With all due respect, Dumbledore sometimes forgets that most of us do not possess powers so great that we can risk offending the most dangerous Dark Lord who ever lived."
5374,175,49,8,"Alright, m'boy!  Bottoms up!"
5375,175,49,2,What's this?
5376,175,49,8,A tonic for the nerves.
5377,175,49,2,What happened to me?
5378,175,49,1,Love potion.
5379,175,49,8,And a bloody strong one at that.
5380,175,49,2,I feel really... bad.
5381,175,49,8,"Pick-me-up's what you need, m'boy. Do us all good, I think.  I've got butterbeer, wine -- ah -- and a dazzling oak-matured mead.  I had other intentions for this but given the circumstances..."
5382,175,49,8,"There we are, Potter.  To life!"
5383,175,49,1,"Ron!  Ron!!!  Professor, help him!"
5384,175,49,8,I d-don't understand --
5385,175,49,1,Professor!  Do something!!
5386,175,49,1,He's choking!!
5387,175,49,1,"Breathe!  C'mon, Ron, don't be a prat.  Breathe!  BREATHE!"
5388,175,49,2,"These girls are gonna kill me, Harry."
5389,175,43,4,"Quick thinking on your part, Harry.  Using a Bezoar.  You must be very proud of your student, eh, Horace?"
5390,175,43,8,Hm?  Oh.  Yes... very proud.
5391,175,43,7,I think we all agree that Mr. Potter's actions were heroic.  The question is:  Why were they necessary.
5392,175,43,4,Why indeed.
5393,175,43,4,"This appears to be a gift, Horace. You don't by chance remember who gave you this bottle, do you -- which by the way possesses remarkably subtle hints of licorice and cherry when not polluted with poison."
5394,175,43,8,Actually I had intended to give it as a gift myself.
5395,175,43,4,To whom might I ask?
5396,175,43,8,"You, Headmaster."
5397,175,43,65,Where is he?  Where's my Won-Won! Has he been asking for me? What's she doing here?
5398,175,43,3,I might ask you the same.
5399,175,43,65,I happen to be his girlfriend.
5400,175,43,3,I happen to be his... friend.
5401,175,43,65,Don't make me laugh.  You haven't spoken in weeks.  I suppose you want to make up with him now that he's suddenly all interesting.
5402,175,43,3,"He's been poisoned, you daft dimbo! And for the record, I've always found him interesting."
5403,175,43,65,"Ha!  See? He senses my presence. I'm here, Won-Won. I'm here --"
5404,175,43,2,Er... My... Nee... Er!  My!  Nee!
5405,175,43,4,"Ah, to be young and feel love's keen sting.  Come, everyone, I think Mr. Weasley is well tended."
5406,175,43,20,"'Bout time, don't you think?"
5407,175,43,8,I've always cherished my students. They're my life...
5408,175,43,3,Oh shut up.
5409,176,36,3,Ron.  Stop.  You're making it snow.
5410,176,36,2,Huh?
5411,176,36,2,Tell me again how I broke up with Lavender?
5412,176,36,3,"Um, well, she came to visit you in the hospital, you see, and you talked -- I don't believe it was a long conversation --"
5413,176,36,2,Don't get me wrong.  I'm bloody thrilled to be shot of her.  It's just she seems... a bit put out.
5414,176,36,3,"Does, doesn't she?  And you say you don't remember a thing from that night?  Not one thing?"
5415,176,36,2,"Well... there is... something. But no.  It can't be.  Besides, I was completely boggled, wasn't I?"
5416,176,36,3,Right.  Boggled...
5417,176,36,3,That's Katie.  That's Katie Bell.
5418,176,36,1,"How are you, Katie?"
5419,176,36,94,"Give me a moment, girls."
5420,176,36,94,"I know you're going to ask, Harry. But I don't know who cursed me. I've tried to remember.  Honestly. But I just... can't..."
5421,176,56,12,Cruci--
5422,176,56,1,Sectumsempra!
5423,176,56,12,Don't touch me!  Don't you dare touch me!
5424,176,39,20,You have to get rid of it.  Today.
5425,177,55,20,Take my hand.
5426,177,55,1,The Room of Requirement...
5427,177,55,20,"Over the years, if someone had a secret, if they wanted to conceal something, this is where they came.  Some of these things are almost as old as the castle itself."
5428,177,55,1,Who showed you this?  First.
5429,177,55,20,Fred and George.  First year.  I hid Tom Riddle's diary here for a time.  Wish I'd left it...
5430,177,55,20,What was that?
5431,177,55,20,"See, you never know what you'll find up here."
5432,177,55,20,All right.  Close your eyes.  That way you can't be tempted.
5433,177,55,20,There's something else.  Another secret of sorts.  One of mine...
5434,177,55,20,"That can stay hidden up here too, if you like."
5435,178,39,2,So.  Did you and Ginny do it?
5436,178,39,1,What?
5437,178,39,2,You know.  Hide the book.
5438,178,39,1,Oh.  Yeah.
5439,178,39,2,"Still no luck with Slughorn, I take it?"
5440,178,39,1,Say that again.
5441,178,39,3,Well?  How do you feel?
5442,178,39,1,Excellent.  Really excellent.
5443,178,39,3,"Now remember.  Slughorn usually eats early, takes a short walk and then returns to his office."
5444,178,39,1,Right.  I'm going down to Hagrid's.
5445,178,39,3,"What?  No, Harry -- you've got to go see Slughorn.  We have a plan --"
5446,178,39,1,"No.  I've got a good feeling about going to Hagrid's.  I feel like it's the place to be tonight, know what I mean?"
5447,178,39,3,No.
5448,178,39,2,No.
5449,178,39,1,Trust me.  I know what I'm doing. Or at least Felix does.
5450,178,38,8,"Merlin's beard, Harry!"
5451,178,38,1,"Sorry, sir.  I should've announced myself.  Cleared my throat. Coughed.  You probably feared I was Madam Sprout."
5452,178,38,8,"Well, yes, actually -- Why would you think that?"
5453,178,38,1,"Just the general behavior, sir. The sneaking around.  The jumping when you saw me.  By the way, those Tentacula leaves -- they're quite valuable, aren't they?"
5454,178,38,8,"Ten galleons a leaf to the right buyer -- not that I'm familiar with such back alley transactions. One hears rumors is all.  My own interests are purely academic, of course."
5455,178,38,1,"Personally, these plants have always kind of freaked me out."
5456,178,38,8,"Exactly how did you get out of the castle, Harry?"
5457,178,38,1,"Through the front doors, sir.  I'm off to Hagrid's, you see.  He's a very dear friend and I felt like paying him a visit.  So if you don't mind, I'll be going."
5458,178,38,8,Harry!
5459,178,38,1,Sir?
5460,178,38,8,It's nearly nightfall.  Surely you realize I can't allow you to roam the grounds all by yourself.
5461,178,38,1,"Well, then by all means come along, sir."
5462,178,40,8,"Harry, I must insist you accompany me back to the castle immediately!"
5463,178,40,1,"That would be counterproductive, sir."
5464,178,40,8,And what makes you say that?
5465,178,40,1,No idea.
5466,178,40,8,Merlin's beard...
5467,178,40,8,Is that an actual Acromantula?
5468,178,40,1,"A dead one, I think, sir."
5469,178,40,5,'Arry.  'Orace.
5470,178,40,8,"My god, dear man.  How did you ever manage to kill it?"
5471,178,40,5,"Kill 'im! Me oldest friend, 'e was!"
5472,178,40,8,"I'm sorry, I... didn't realize."
5473,178,40,5,"Ah, don' worry yerself.  Yer not alone.  Seriously misunderstood creatures -- spiders.  It's the eyes, I reckon.  Unnerve people."
5474,178,40,1,Not to mention the pincers.
5475,178,40,5,I reckon that too... How'd yeh get outta the castle anyways?
5476,178,40,1,Through the front doors.
5477,178,40,8,"Hagrid.  I wouldn't want to be indelicate, but Acromantula venom is uncommonly rare and, well, if you wouldn't mind my extracting a vial or two -- purely for academic pursuits..."
5478,178,40,5,"Don' suppose it's doin' 'im any good, izzit?"
5479,178,40,8,"My thoughts exactly!  Always carry a few spare ampoules for just such occasions.  Old Potion Master's habit, you know..."
5480,178,40,5,Wish yeh coulda seen 'im in 'is prime.  Magnificent 'e was.  Jus' magnificent...
5481,178,40,8,Why don't I say a few words?  I trust he had family?
5482,178,40,1,Oh yeah.
5483,178,40,8,Farewell...
5484,178,40,5,Aragog.
5485,178,40,8,"Farewell, Aragog, king of arachnids.  Though your body will decay, your spirit lingers on in the quiet, web-spun places of your Forest home.  May your many-eyed descendents ever flourish and your human friends find solace for the loss they have sustained."
5486,178,40,5,Tha' was... tha' was... beautiful.
5487,179,40,8,"And Odo the hero, they bore him back home..."
5488,179,40,5,"To the place he'd known as a lad, They laid him to rest with his hat inside out and his wand snapped in two, which was sad..."
5489,179,40,5,"I had 'im from an egg, yeh know. Tiny little thing he was when he hatched.  No bigger'n a Pekinese."
5490,179,40,8,Sweet.  I once had a fish. Francis.  Lovely little thing. One day I came downstairs and he'd vanished.  Poof.
5491,179,40,5,Tha's odd.
5492,179,40,8,"Isn't it?  That's life, I suppose. One goes along and then... poof."
5493,179,40,8,"That's never unicorn hair, Hagrid?"
5494,179,40,8,"Hagrid looks up, reels a bit.  Nods."
5495,179,40,8,"But my dear chap, do you know how much that's worth?"
5496,179,40,5,No idea... no idea at all...
5497,179,40,8,"It was a student who gave me Francis.  One spring afternoon I discovered a bowl upon my desk with a few inches of clear water. There was a flower petal floating upon the surface.  As I watched, the petal sank, but just before it touched bottom... it transformed. Into a wee fish.  It was beautiful magic, wondrous to behold.  The petal had come from a lily."
5498,179,40,8,"Your mother.  The day I came downstairs, the day I found the bowl empty... was the day she..."
5499,179,40,8,I know what you want.  But I can't give it to you.  It will ruin me...
5500,179,40,1,Do you know why I survived?  The night I got this.
5501,179,40,1,Because of her.  Because she sacrificed herself.  Because she refused to step aside.  Because her love was more powerful than Voldemort.
5502,179,40,8,Please don't say his --
5503,179,40,1,"I'm not afraid of the name, Professor.  And I'm not afraid of him.  And you shouldn't be either. She didn't just die for me that night.  She died for you too.  She died for everyone who's ever woken in the middle of the night afraid a Death Eater waited on their doorstep."
5504,179,40,1,"Professor.  I'm going to tell you something, something others have only guessed at.  It's true.  I am the Chosen One."
5505,179,40,1,"Only I can kill him.  But in order to do so, I need to know what Tom Riddle asked you that night in your office all those years ago. And I need to know what you told him."
5506,179,40,1,"Be brave, Professor.  Be brave like my mother.  Otherwise you disgrace her.  Otherwise she died for nothing.  Otherwise, the bowl remains empty forever."
5507,179,40,8,Don't think too badly of me once you've seen it.  You don't know what he was like... even then.
5508,180,48,4,How is he?  Horace?
5509,180,48,24,"Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?"
5510,180,48,8,"Now, Tom, I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I?  I must say, m'boy, I'd like to know where you get your information.  More knowledgable than half the staff, you are. By the way, thank you for the pineapple -- you're quite right, it is my favorite -- how is it you knew?"
5511,180,48,24,Intuition.
5512,180,48,8,"Good gracious, is it that time already?  Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippett will have us all in detention.  Lestrange, Avery, don't forget your essays..."
5513,180,48,8,"Look sharp, Tom.  You don't want to be caught out of bed after hours..."
5514,180,48,24,I know a secret shortcut or two.
5515,180,48,8,"Yes, I imagine you do.  Something on your mind, Tom?"
5516,180,48,24,"Yes, sir.  I couldn't think of anyone else to go to.  The other Professors, well, they're not like you.  They might... misunderstand."
5517,180,48,8,Go on.
5518,180,48,24,"I was in the library the other night, in the Restricted section, and I read something rather odd, about a bit of rare magic and I thought perhaps you could illuminate me.  It's called, as I understand it... a Horcrux."
5519,180,48,8,Excuse me?
5520,180,48,24,Horcrux.  I came across the term while reading and I didn't fully understand it.
5521,180,48,8,"I'm not sure what you were reading, Tom, but that's very Dark stuff, very Dark indeed."
5522,180,48,24,"Yes, sir.  Which is why I came to you.  I mean no disrespect to the rest of the staff, but I thought if anyone could tell me... it would be you."
5523,180,48,8,A Horcrux is an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul.
5524,180,48,24,"Yes, I thought it might be something like that.  But I don't understand how that works, sir."
5525,180,48,8,"One splits one's soul and hides part of it in an object.  By doing so, you are protected should you be attacked and your body destroyed."
5526,180,48,24,Protected?
5527,180,48,8,"That part of your soul that was hidden, lives on.  In other words, you cannot die."
5528,180,48,24,"How does one split his soul, sir?"
5529,180,48,8,"I think you can guess the answer to that, Tom."
5530,180,48,24,Murder.
5531,180,48,8,"Yes.  Killing rips the soul apart. It is a violation against nature. After, one is never the same."
5532,180,48,24,"Out of curiosity, sir -- can you only split your soul once?  For instance, isn't seven the most powerfully magical number --"
5533,180,48,8,"Seven!  Merlin's beard, Tom! Isn't it bad enough to think of killing one person?  To rip the soul into seven pieces..."
5534,180,48,8,"This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom?  All academic..."
5535,180,48,24,"Of course, sir.  And I promise I'll not speak of our conversation.  It'll be our little secret..."
5536,180,41,1,Sir --
5537,180,41,4,This is beyond anything I imagined.  In my life I have seen things that are unimaginably horrific.  I know now... you will see worse.
5538,180,41,1,"Do you mean to say he succeeded, sir?  In making a Horcrux?"
5539,180,41,4,"Oh he succeeded.  And not just once.  Think, Harry.  He's just told us."
5540,180,41,1,Seven.  He made seven -- the most powerfully magical number.  But... what are they exactly?
5541,180,41,4,"They can be anything.  The most commonplace of objects.  A ring, for example.  Or a book..."
5542,180,41,1,Tom Riddle's diary --
5543,180,41,4,"It's a Horcrux, yes.  Four years ago, when you saved Ginny Weasley's life in the Chamber of Secrets, when you brought me this I knew.  This was a different kind of magic.  Very dark.  Very powerful.  But until tonight, I had no idea just how powerful..."
5544,180,41,1,And the ring...?
5545,180,41,4,Belonged to Voldemort's mother. It was difficult to find and...
5546,180,41,1,... even more difficult to destroy. But if you could find them all. If you did destroy each Horcrux...
5547,180,41,4,One destroys Voldemort.
5548,180,41,1,"But how would you find them?  They could be hidden anywhere, couldn't they..."
5549,180,41,4,"True.  But magic, especially Dark magic..."
5550,180,41,4,... leaves traces.
5551,180,41,1,"It's where you've been going, isn't it, sir?  When you leave the school."
5552,180,41,4,Yes.  And I think... perhaps... I may have found another.  But this time I cannot hope to destroy it alone.
5553,180,41,4,"Once again, I shall ask too much of you."
5554,180,45,3,Harry.  It's time.
5555,180,45,1,"Hermione, is the Room of Requirement unplottable?"
5556,180,45,3,If one wants it to be.  Why?
5557,180,45,1,It would explain why I thought Malfoy was leaving the castle when he disappeared off the Map.
5558,180,45,1,He was going to the Room of Requirement.
5559,180,45,3,"Of course, and that explains the Vanishing Cabinet as well!"
5560,180,45,2,No.  I got an owl from Dad this morning.  The one at Borgin & Burke's?  It's still there.
5561,180,45,1,But I'm telling you.  I saw it --
5562,180,45,1,What if there are two?  Vanishing cabinets.
5563,180,45,3,What if there are?
5564,180,45,1,I don't know...
5565,180,45,2,"Good luck, mate."
5566,180,45,1,I don't need luck.  I'll be with Dumbledore.
5567,180,23,6,Have you ever considered that you ask too much?  That you take too much for granted?  Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind that I don't want to do this anymore?
5568,180,23,4,"Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.  I will not negotiate this with you, Severus.  You agreed.  There's nothing more to discuss."
5569,180,23,4,"Harry.  You need a shave, my friend."
5570,180,23,4,"At times I forget how much you've grown.  At times I still see the small boy from the cupboard. Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.  I am an old man."
5571,180,23,1,"You look the same to me, sir."
5572,180,23,4,"Like your mother, you are unfailingly kind."
5573,180,23,4,A trait people never fail to undervalue.  I'm afraid.
5574,180,23,4,"The place to which we journey tonight is exceedingly dangerous, Harry.  I promised that you could accompany me and I stand by that promise.  But there is a condition:  You must obey any command I give you -- without question."
5575,180,23,1,"Yes, sir."
5576,180,23,4,"Understand what I'm saying. Should I tell you to hide, you must hide."
5577,180,23,4,"Should I tell you to run, you will run."
5578,180,23,4,And should I tell you to abandon me and save yourself...
5579,180,23,4,You will do so.
5580,180,23,4,"Your word, Harry."
5581,180,23,1,My word.
5582,180,23,4,Take my arm.
5583,180,23,1,"Sir, I thought one couldn't Apparate within Hogwarts."
5584,180,23,4,Being me has its privileges.
5585,180,73,1,"It's there, isn't it?"
5586,180,73,4,"This is the place.  Oh yes, this place has known magic. Where you stand, Harry, Tom Riddle once stood many, many years ago, when he was but a poor orphan boy with a penchant for cruelty..."
5587,180,73,4,"One wintry afternoon, he lured two younger classmates to this cave. What happened is unclear.  But this much is known:  the children were damaged."
5588,180,73,1,Sir!
5589,180,73,4,"In order to gain passage, payment must be made, payment intended to weaken any intruder."
5590,180,73,1,"You should've let me, sir."
5591,180,73,4,"Oh, no, Harry.  Your blood is much more precious than mine."
5592,180,73,4,Careful.  The water.
5593,180,73,4,It's there.  The only question is how do we get to it?
5594,180,73,1,"We couldn't, perhaps, just try a Summoning Charm, sir?"
5595,180,73,1,Accio Horcrux!
5596,180,73,4,Perhaps not.
5597,180,73,4,"If you would, Harry..."
5598,180,73,1,Sir... have you ever taken Felix Felicis?
5599,180,73,4,"Only recreationally.  You see, I believe one creates one's own luck."
5600,180,73,1,Professor... there are bodies in this lake.
5601,180,73,4,Yes.
5602,180,73,4,Remember... the water.
5603,180,73,1,"Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?"
5604,180,73,4,Oh yes.
5605,180,73,4,It has to be drunk.
5606,180,73,4,"You remember the condition on which I brought you with me? This potion might paralyze me.  It might cause me to forget why I'm here.  It might create so much pain I beg for relief.  You are not to indulge these requests, Harry.  It is your job to make sure I keep drinking this potion even if you have to force it down my throat.  Understood?"
5607,180,73,1,"Why can't I drink it, sir?"
5608,180,73,4,"Because I am much older, much cleverer... and much less valuable. Your good health, Harry."
5609,180,73,1,Professor?
5610,180,73,1,Professor?  Can you hear me?
5611,180,73,4,Don't... don't make me...
5612,180,73,1,"You... you can't stop, Professor. You've got to keep drinking.  Like you said.  Remember."
5613,180,73,4,Nooooooo!!!
5614,180,73,4,Make it stop... Please... make it stop...
5615,180,73,1,"It will, sir.  It'll stop.  But only if you drink..."
5616,180,73,4,My fault.  It's all my fault...
5617,180,73,4,"Too much... I can't... take it... I want... to die... kill... kill me... KILL ME, HARRY!"
5618,180,73,1,What?
5619,180,73,4,"Your word, Harry!  Your word!"
5620,180,73,1,No...
5621,180,73,4,Kill me!  It's the only way!
5622,180,73,1,One more.  Just one more.  And then -- I promise... I'll do what you say.
5623,180,73,1,I promise.
5624,180,73,4,Water. Water...
5625,180,73,4,Aguamenti.
5626,180,73,1,"You did it, sir.  Look --"
5627,180,73,4,Water!
5628,180,73,1,"I'm trying, sir.  I'm --"
5629,180,73,4,Go...
5630,180,73,4,We have to... go.
5631,180,73,1,"Don't worry, sir.  We're nearly there."
5632,180,73,4,"I am not worried, Harry.  I am with you."
5633,181,23,7,To your Houses.  No dawdling.
5634,181,23,1,"We need to get you up to the hospital, sir, to Madam Pomfrey --"
5635,181,23,4,No.  Severus... Severus is who I need... Go and wake him... Tell him what has happened...
5636,181,23,4,Speak to no one else... I... I shall wait here...
5637,181,23,1,All right.  Okay.
5638,181,23,1,"Sir, are you... praying?"
5639,181,23,4,"No, Harry.  I do not pray.  I was merely closing a window -- the one that had allowed us to Apparate."
5640,181,23,4,Hide yourself below.  And do not speak or show yourself without my permission.  No matter what.
5641,181,23,4,"Do as I say, Harry."
5642,181,23,4,Trust me.
5643,181,23,4,"Good evening, Draco.  What brings you out on such a fine Spring evening?  Or is it Summer?"
5644,181,23,12,Who else is here?  I heard you talking.
5645,181,23,4,"I often talk aloud to myself.  I find it extraordinarily useful. That which sounds sane at a whisper can seem utterly mad when said for all the world to hear. Haven't been whispering to yourself, have you, Draco?"
5646,181,23,4,"You are not an assassin, Draco."
5647,181,23,12,How do you know what I am?  I've done things that would shock you.
5648,181,23,4,"Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping she would, in turn, bear a cursed necklace to me?  Like replacing a bottle of mead with one laced with poison.  Forgive me, Draco, but these are attempts so feeble I cannot help but question if your heart has been really in them. I'm curious.  When Voldemort gave you this task, when he asked you to kill me, was it in a whisper?"
5649,181,23,12,He trusts me!  I was chosen!
5650,181,23,4,Then I shall make it easy for you.
5651,181,23,12,Expelliarumus!
5652,181,23,4,"Well done, Draco.  But I warn you. Killing is not nearly as easy."
5653,181,23,4,You're not alone.  Are you.  There are others.  How?
5654,181,23,12,The Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirement.
5655,181,23,4,That cabinet has been broken for years.
5656,181,23,12,I've been mending it.
5657,181,23,4,Ingenious.  Let me guess.  It has a sister.  A twin.
5658,181,23,12,In Borgin & Burkes.  They form --
5659,181,23,4,"A passage, yes.  Very good. I once knew a boy years ago who made all the wrong choices.  Let me help you, Draco."
5660,181,23,12,I don't want your help!  Don't you see!  I have to do it!  I have to! I've got to kill you or he'll kill me.
5661,181,23,4,"Say that again, Draco.  But aloud this time."
5662,181,23,22,"Well now, look what we have here. Dumbledore.  Wandless and alone."
5663,181,23,22,"Cornered in his own castle.  Well done, Draco."
5664,181,23,4,"Good evening, Bellatrix.  I think introductions are in order."
5665,181,23,22,"Love to, Albus.  But I'm afraid we're on a bit of a tight schedule."
5666,181,23,102,Do it.
5667,181,23,22,He doesn't have the stomach.  Like his father.  Let me finish him. In my own way.
5668,181,23,6,"No!  The Dark Lord was clear.  The boy's to do it.  Go on, Draco. Now!"
5669,181,23,6,No.
5670,181,23,4,Severus...
5671,181,23,22,"Well, look who's here.  Hogwarts own Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.  Come to see the slaughter?"
5672,181,23,4,Severus... please.
5673,181,23,6,I gave my word.  I made a vow...
5674,181,23,6,Avada Kedavra!
5675,182,23,6,You can no longer stay here.
5676,182,23,22,Boo.
5677,182,23,22,Draco!  Draco! They'll kill you if you stay.
5678,182,23,6,Go on!
5679,182,23,6,Go on!
5680,182,40,1,Cruciatus!
5681,182,40,1,Incacerata!
5682,182,40,1,Impedimenta!
5683,182,40,1,"Fight!  Fight back, you coward!"
5684,182,40,6,Don't ever associate that word and my name again.
5685,182,40,6,No!  He belongs to the Dark Lord!
5686,182,40,1,Sectumsempra!
5687,182,40,6,"You dare use my own spells against me, Potter?"
5688,182,40,6,"You may have gotten your mother's eyes, but you're as dim as your father.  Yes.  It's me.  I'm the Half-Blood Prince."
5689,182,40,1,Hagrid... HAGRID!
5690,182,40,1,Hagrid!  You alright?
5691,182,40,5,"Take more'n tha' ter finish me off.  Not sure about me 'ouse, tho'.  But if anybody can put it righ', Dumbledore can."
5692,182,40,1,"Hagrid, Dumbledore --"
5693,182,40,5,Only thing I can't reckon is wha' Snape was doin' with tha' lot.
5694,182,40,5,"An' wha's this wi' the Dark Mar'? Who's been killed? Where's Dumbledore, 'arry? Where's Dumbledore!!"
5695,183,41,7,Potter.
5696,183,41,7,"Potter, in light of what's happened... should you feel the need to talk to someone..."
5697,183,41,7,You should know... Professor Dumbledore...
5698,183,41,7,You meant a great deal to him.
5699,183,23,3,Dumbledore.
5700,183,23,1,Do you think he would've done it. Draco?
5701,183,23,1,"No.  He was lowering his wand.  In the end, it was Snape.  It was always Snape.  And I did nothing..."
5702,183,23,3,Strange.  Thinking this is a piece of Voldemort's soul...
5703,183,23,1,"Yeah, strange.  Only... it's not. It's a fake."
5704,183,23,1,Go on.  Open it.
5705,183,23,3,"'To the Dark Lord.  I know I will be dead long before you read this but I want you to know that it was I who discovered your secret.  I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can.  I face death in the hope that when you meet your match, you will be mortal once more.  R.A.B.'"
5706,183,23,1,"Dunno.  But whoever they are, they have the real Horcrux.  Which means, it was a waste.  All of it."
5707,183,23,3,"Ron's okay with it, you know.  You and Ginny.  But if I were you, when he's around, I'd keep the snogging to a minimum."
5708,183,23,1,"I'm not coming back, Hermione."
5709,183,23,3,We reckoned -- Ron and me.
5710,183,23,1,I have to finish what Dumbledore started. I'm not sure where that will lead me... but I'll let you and Ron konw where I am -- when I can.
5711,183,23,3,"I've always admired your courage, Harry, but sometimes... you're really thick."
5712,183,23,3,"You don't honestly think you can find all those Horcruxes by yourself, do you? You need us, Harry."
5713,183,23,1,Yeah.  I do.  But do me a favor. When I'm around?  Keep the snogging to a minimum.
5714,183,23,3,Like that's going to happen.
5715,183,23,3,"Besides, he's barking."
5716,183,23,1,"Funny, he says the same about you."
5717,183,23,3,"Yes, but I'm exceptionally perceptive."
5718,183,23,1,You're brilliant.  You both are.
5719,183,23,3,Do you think we'll ever... come back?
5720,183,23,1,I don't know. I never realised how beautiful this place was.
5721,184,70,51,"These are dark times, there is no denying.  Our world has perhaps faced no greater threat than it does today.  But I say this to our citizenry:  we, ever your servants, continue to defend your liberty and repel the forces that would seek to take it from you. Your Ministry remains strong..."
5722,184,17,95,"Hermione.  Your tea is ready, dear."
5723,184,17,3,"Coming, Mum."
5724,184,17,95,Don't you look lovely.  All packed?
5725,184,17,110,Are you sure these biscuits are sugar-free?
5726,184,17,95,"Quite sure, dear.  See the big bold letters that say 'Sugar Free'?  Dead giveaway."
5727,184,17,110,"Mm.  Yes. Hello, kitten.  Don't you look lovely."
5728,184,17,95,"Darling, don't be suspicious the biscuits taste so good, be grateful the company's so clever..."
5729,184,17,3,Obliviate.
5730,184,17,3,Goodbye.
5731,184,17,2,What are those?
5732,184,17,16,Close the door.
5733,184,17,16,"These are for the Order.  So many are on the run now, it helps them to stay connected with the rest of us.  Know they're not alone..."
5734,184,17,2,C'mon.  Mum's got dinner ready.
5735,185,13,9,Severus.  I was beginning to worry you'd lost your way.  Come.  I've saved you a seat.
5736,185,13,9,"You know our hosts, of course, Severus.  Narcissa in particular has been most hospitable.  Lucius, on the other hand, is, I fear, burdened by my presence.  Are you, Lucius?"
5737,185,13,23,My lord?
5738,185,13,9,Are you burdened?
5739,185,13,63,My lord is always welcome here.
5740,185,13,9,"You bring news I trust, Severus?"
5741,185,13,6,It will happen Saturday next.  At nightfall.
5742,185,13,9,And this information comes --
5743,185,13,6,-- from the source we discussed.
5744,185,13,70,"I have heard differently, my lord. Dawlish, the Auror, let slip that the Potter boy will not be moved until the thirtieth of this month, the night before he turns seventeen."
5745,185,13,6,This is a false trail.  The Auror Office no longer plays any part in the protection of Harry Potter. Those closest to him believe we have infiltrated the Ministry.
5746,185,13,129,"Well, they've got that right, then, 'aven't they?"
5747,185,13,9,"Pius, what say you?"
5748,185,13,96,"One hears many things, my lord. Whether the truth is among them is not clear."
5749,185,13,9,"Spoken like a true politician. You will, I think, prove most useful, Pius.  Where will he be taken?  The boy?"
5750,185,13,6,"To a safehouse.  Likely the home of someone in the Order.  I'm told it has been given every manner of protection possible. Once there, it will be impractical to attack him.  We may have compromised the Ministry, but there are those who remain loyal to him.  As long as the Ministry stands, his allies within will have the means at their disposal to insure his safety."
5751,185,13,22,"My lord, if I might, I'd like to volunteer myself for this task. I'd like to kill the boy."
5752,185,13,9,Wormtail!  Have I not spoken to you about keeping our guest quiet?
5753,185,13,44,"Yes, m-my lord.  Right away, my lord."
5754,185,13,9,"As inspiring as I find your bloodlust, Bellatrix, I must be the one to kill Harry Potter.  But I face an unfortunate complication.  It has recently come to my attention that my wand and Potter's share the same core. They are, in some ways, twins.  We can wound but not fatally harm one another.  Which means, if I am to kill him... I will have to do it with another's wand."
5755,185,13,9,"Come now.  Surely one of you would like the honor?  What about... you, Lucius?"
5756,185,13,9,I require your wand.
5757,185,13,9,Do I detect elm?
5758,185,13,23,"Yes, my lord."
5759,185,13,9,And the core?
5760,185,13,23,Dragon -- dragon heartstring.
5761,185,13,9,My wand?  You can't possibly think I would give you my wand.
5762,185,13,23,"No, my lord."
5763,185,13,9,"For those of you who do not know, we are joined tonight by Miss Charity Burbage who until recently taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  Her specialty was Muggle studies. It is Miss Burbage's belief that Muggles are not so different from us."
5764,185,13,9,"She would, given her way, have us mate with them.  To her, the mixture of magical and Muggle blood is not an abomination but something to be encouraged.  I, of course, take a contrary view.  But we're all civilized here.  All adults.  We can agree to disagree."
5765,185,13,121,"Severus, please.  We're friends..."
5766,185,13,9,Avada Kedavra!
5767,185,13,9,Nagini... Dinner.
5768,186,8,21,"Come now, Dudley.  Hurry up!"
5769,186,8,1,Time for the teary farewell.
5770,186,8,32,I've lived in this house twenty years.  And now -- in a single night -- I'm expected to leave.
5771,186,8,1,"They'll torture you.  Even Dudley. If they think you know where I'm going, they'll stop at noth--"
5772,186,8,32,You think I don't know that?  You think I don't know what they're capable of?
5773,186,8,32,"You didn't just lose a mother that night in Godric's Hollow, you know.  I lost a sister."
5774,186,8,1,Do you have any?  Magic?
5775,186,8,32,What a cruel thing to ask.
5776,186,8,21,"Well, this is goodbye then, boy."
5777,186,8,31,I don't understand.  Isn't he coming with us?
5778,186,8,21,Who?
5779,186,8,31,Harry.
5780,186,8,21,Absolutely not.
5781,186,8,31,Why?
5782,186,8,21,"Well, because -- he doesn't want to, do you, boy?"
5783,186,8,1,"Absolutely not.  Besides, I'm just a waste of space.  Isn't that right, Vernon?"
5784,186,8,21,"Come on, Dudley, we're off."
5785,186,8,31,I don't think you're a waste of space.
5786,186,8,1,Well... thanks.
5787,186,8,1,"See you, Big D."
5788,186,8,1,Good riddance.
5789,186,8,5,"All righ', 'arry?  Yeh look fit."
5790,186,8,13,"Yeah, he's ruddy gorgeous.  What say we get undercover before someone murders him."
5791,186,8,1,"I thought you were looking after the Prime Minister, Kingsley."
5792,186,8,56,You're more important.
5793,186,8,73,"Hello, Harry.  Bill Weasley."
5794,186,8,14,Wasn't always this handsome.
5795,186,8,19,Dead ugly.
5796,186,8,73,True enough.  Owe it all to a werewolf by name of Greyback. Hope to repay the favor one day.
5797,186,8,81,"You are still beautiful to me, William."
5798,186,8,11,"Just remember, Fleur, once you're married:  Bill takes his steaks on the raw side now."
5799,186,8,61,"My husband, the joker.  By the way, wait until you hear the news! Remus and I are --"
5800,186,8,13,"All right, all right!  You'll all have time for a cozy catch-up later!  We've got to get the hell out of here and soon!"
5801,186,8,13,"Potter, you're underage, which means you've still got the Trace on you."
5802,186,8,1,The Trace?
5803,186,8,13,"You sneeze and the Ministry will know who wipes your nose.  Point is, we have to use those means of transport the Trace can't detect: brooms, thestrals and the like. We'll go in pairs.  That way if anyone's out there waiting for us -- and I reckon there will be -- they won't know which Harry Potter is the real one."
5804,186,8,1,The real one...?
5805,186,8,13,I believe you're familiar with this particular brew.
5806,186,8,1,No!  Absolutely not!
5807,186,8,3,I told you he'd take it well.
5808,186,8,1,If you think I'm going to let people risk their lives for me --
5809,186,8,2,"Never done that before, have we?"
5810,186,8,1,This is different.  Taking that. Becoming me -- no.
5811,186,8,14,"Well, none of us really fancy it, mate."
5812,186,8,19,"Yeah, imagine if something went wrong and we were stuck as scrawny, specky gits forever."
5813,186,8,13,"Everyone here's of age, Potter, and they've all agreed to take the risk."
5814,186,8,76,"Technically, I've been coerced. Mundungus Fletcher, Mr. Potter. I've always been a huge admirer."
5815,186,8,13,"Nip it, Mundungus!  All right, Granger, as discussed."
5816,186,8,1,"Blimey, Hermione!"
5817,186,8,13,"Straight in here, if you please."
5818,186,8,13,"For those of you who haven't taken Polyjuice Potion before, fair warning.  It tastes like goblin piss."
5819,186,8,14,"Have a lot of experience with that, do you, Mad-Eye?"
5820,186,8,14,Just trying to defuse the tension.
5821,186,8,14,Wow -- we're identical!
5822,186,8,19,Wow -- we're identical!
5823,186,8,13,Not yet you aren't.
5824,186,8,19,"Don't have something a bit more sporty, do you?"
5825,186,8,14,"Yes, don't fancy this color at all."
5826,186,8,13,"Fancy this:  You're not you, so shut it and strip. You'll need to change too, Potter."
5827,186,8,81,"Bill, look away -- I'm 'ideous."
5828,186,8,2,I knew Ginny was lying about that tattoo.
5829,186,8,3,"Harry, your eyesight really is awful."
5830,186,8,13,Blimey.  I almost forgot.
5831,186,8,13,"Right then.  We'll be pairing off. Each Potter will have a protector. As for you, Harry..."
5832,186,8,1,Yes?
5833,186,8,13,"The real Harry!  Where the devil are you, anyway?"
5834,186,8,1,Here.
5835,186,8,13,You'll ride with Hagrid.
5836,186,8,5,Brought yeh here sixteen years ago when you were barely bigger than a Bowtruckle. Seems only righ' I should be the one ter take yeh away.
5837,186,8,13,"Yeah, it's all very touching. Let's go."
5838,187,17,13,"Good luck, everyone.  On the count of three.  One... two --"
5839,187,17,1,Hagrid!  We've got to help the others!
5840,187,17,5,"Can't do it, 'arry.  My job's ter get you where we're goin' safe 'n sound -- Mad-Eye's orders!"
5841,187,17,1,What was that?
5842,187,17,5,Dragon fire!
5843,187,17,129,That's him!  The real one!
5844,187,17,5,"Hol' tight, 'arry!  We've got ter get yeh out of here!"
5845,187,17,1,Hagrid... HAGRID...!
5846,187,17,9,Avada...
5847,188,17,26,Harry!  Hagrid!  What happened?! Have you seen the others?
5848,188,17,1,Is no one back yet?
5849,188,17,5,"They were on us from the star', Molly -- the Death Eaters.  And You-Know-Who as well."
5850,188,17,26,"Well, thank goodness you two are all right."
5851,188,17,5,"Haven't go' any brandy, have yeh, Molly?  Fer medicinal purposes?"
5852,188,17,20,Ron and Tonks should've already been back.  Dad and Fred as well.
5853,188,17,20,Oh my God!  George!
5854,188,17,11,The house!  Quickly!
5855,188,17,26,My boy!  My darling boy!  What've they done to you?!
5856,188,17,20,Remus!  What're you doing!
5857,188,17,11,What creature sat in the corner the first time that Harry Potter visited my office at Hogwarts!
5858,188,17,1,Are you mad...?
5859,188,17,11,What Creature!
5860,188,17,1,A grindylow!
5861,188,17,11,We've been betrayed.  Voldemort knew you were being moved tonight. I had to make sure you weren't an imposter.
5862,188,17,1,Who did this to him?
5863,188,17,11,"Snape. He'll be fine, Molly.  But that's Dark Magic.  The damage is done."
5864,188,17,5,Someone else is back.
5865,188,17,56,The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke to the pair of us?
5866,188,17,11,'Harry is the best hope we have. Trust him.'
5867,188,17,56,What gave you away?
5868,188,17,1,Hedwig -- I think.  She was trying to protect me --
5869,188,17,2,Hey ya -- Well... thanks.
5870,188,17,61,"Deserves that.  Brilliant, he was. Wouldn't be standing here without him."
5871,188,17,3,Really?
5872,188,17,2,Always the tone of surprise.
5873,188,17,16,Are we the last?  Where's George?
5874,188,17,16,Remus.  Where's my son?
5875,188,17,14,"How do you feel, Georgie?"
5876,188,17,19,Saint-like.
5877,188,17,14,Come again?
5878,188,17,19,"Saint-like... You see, I'm holy. Holey, Fred, geddit?"
5879,188,17,14,"With the whole wide world of ear- related humor at your disposal, you go for holey?  Pathetic."
5880,188,17,19,"Reckon I'm still better-looking than you.  Better-looking than Bill, that's for sure."
5881,188,17,73,Mad-Eye's dead.
5882,188,17,73,Mundungus took one look at Voldemort and Disapparated.
5883,188,17,11,Mad-Eye reckoned You-Know-Who would expect the real Harry to be with the most skilled Auror.  He knew he'd be in the most danger.
5884,188,17,16,It doesn't explain how they knew we were moving Harry tonight.
5885,188,17,5,"Wha'?  One of us?  Tha's mad.  I'd wager me life it wasn' none of you lot.  An' if it was me I'd kno', wouldn' I?  Talk in me sleep on occasion, I'll admit, but there's only Fang aroun' ter hear an' mostly it's gibberish an' besides I'd cut me tongue out 'fore 'd betray 'arry e'en in me dreams --"
5886,188,17,5,Wha's so funny!
5887,188,17,1,"I trust you with my life, Hagrid. I trust everyone in this room. Understood?"
5888,188,17,5,"'Ear, 'ear."
5889,188,17,11,Better.
5890,188,17,43,"No!  No!  I believed a different wand would work, I swear!"
5891,188,17,9,Then explain this!
5892,188,17,43,But it makes no sense...
5893,188,17,9,"Perhaps our friend's loyalties lie elsewhere, Wormtail."
5894,188,17,43,No!  There must be a way!  I'll think of something else!
5895,188,17,9,"I hope so, Ollivander, for your sake.  I won't be so forgiving next time..."
5896,188,17,2,Going somewhere?
5897,188,17,1,No one else is going to die.  Not for me.
5898,188,17,2,"For you?  You think Madeye died for you?  You think George took that curse for you?  You may be the Chosen One, mate, but this is a whole lot bigger than that."
5899,188,17,1,Come with me.  Now.
5900,188,17,2,And leave Hermione?  Are you mad? We wouldn't last two days without her.
5901,188,17,2,"Don't tell her I said that. Besides, you've still got the Trace on you.  And there's the wedding..."
5902,188,17,1,Wedding?
5903,188,17,2,"Bill and Fleur.  Mum's been planning it for months.  Only thing that's kept her sane, I reckon.  She'll kill me if I miss it.  Kill you too.  Rather go face to face with You-Know-Who if I'm honest."
5904,188,17,1,I don't care about a bloody wedding -- no matter whose it is. I have to start searching for the Horcruxes.  It's the only chance we have to beat him.  And the longer we wait the stronger he gets.
5905,188,17,2,"Tonight's not the night, mate. You'd only be doing him a favor."
5906,188,17,2,Do you think he knows?
5907,188,17,2,"I mean, they're bits of his soul, the Horcruxes.  Bits of him.  When Dumbledore destroyed the ring and you destroyed Tom Riddle's diary all those years ago -- he must've felt something right?"
5908,188,17,2,"What I'm saying is, if we do this thing right, if we find the Horcruxes and begin to destroy them one by one..."
5909,188,17,2,Won't he know he's being hunted?
5910,189,17,16,All together now!
5911,189,17,16,One.  Two.  Three!
5912,189,17,20,Were you going to tell me?
5913,189,17,1,Yes.
5914,189,17,20,And Ron and Hermione.  They'll not be going back to Hogwarts either?
5915,189,17,20,I see.
5916,189,17,1,"Dumbledore didn't want anyone to know what it is we're doing.  If I tell you, I'd be betraying him."
5917,189,17,20,"Zip me up, will you."
5918,189,17,20,"Seems silly, doesn't it?  A wedding.  Given everything that's going on."
5919,189,17,1,Maybe that's the best reason to have it.  Because of everything that's going on.
5920,189,17,19,Morning.
5921,189,17,16,"How's it look on your end, boys?"
5922,189,17,14,Brilliant!
5923,189,17,19,"Bloody hell, what's the Minister of Magic doing here?"
5924,189,17,2,Dunno.  But something tells me he didn't come to give away the bride.
5925,189,17,1,"To what do we owe the pleasure, Minister?"
5926,189,17,51,"I think we both know the answer to that question, Mr. Potter."
5927,189,17,1,And this would be...?
5928,189,17,51,"Don't be coy, Mr. Potter.  Mr. Weasley.  Would you say you were close to your former Headmaster?"
5929,189,17,2,Dumbledore?  And me?  I dunno. I reckon I was just another Weasley to him.  He was always polite --
5930,189,17,51,"And you, Miss Granger?  How would you characterize your relationship?"
5931,189,17,3,"We were friendly, not close like Harry, but --"
5932,189,17,1,What's this all about?
5933,189,17,51,"This.  Despite the fact that neither of your friends appear to have been particularly close to their recently deceased Headmaster, he saw fit to remember them in his will.  Now why do you suppose that would be?"
5934,189,17,1,No idea.
5935,189,17,51,"Come now, you don't expect me to believe..."
5936,189,17,51,"'Herein is set forth the Last Will and Testament of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore.  First, to Ronald Bilius Weasley, I leave my Deluminator, a device of my own making, in the hope that -- when things seem most dark -- it will show him the light.'"
5937,189,17,2,Dumbledore left this?  For me? Brilliant.  Er -- what is it?
5938,189,17,2,Wicked.
5939,189,17,51,"'To Miss Hermione Jean Granger, I leave my copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, in the hope that she will find it entertaining and instructive.'"
5940,189,17,2,"Mum used to read me those!  The Wizard and the Hopping Pot, Babbitty Rabbity and her Cackling Stump..."
5941,189,17,2,"Oh, c'mon!  Beedle's stories are famous!  Babbity Rabbitty? No...?"
5942,189,17,51,"'To Harry James Potter, I leave the Snitch he caught in his first Quidditch match at Hogwarts, as a reminder of the rewards of perseverance and skill."
5943,189,17,1,That's it then?
5944,189,17,51,"Not quite.  Dumbledore left you a second bequest:  The Sword of Godric Gryffindor.  Unfortunately, the Sword of Gryffindor was not Dumbledore's to give away.  As an important historical artifact, it belongs..."
5945,189,17,3,To Harry!  It belongs to Harry! It chose him!  It came to him in the Chamber of Secrets when he most needed it!
5946,189,17,51,"The sword may present itself to any worthy Gryffindor, Miss Granger.  That does not make it that wizard's property.  And in any event the current whereabouts of the sword are unknown."
5947,189,17,1,Excuse me?
5948,189,17,51,"The sword is missing. I won't pretend to be your friend, Mr. Potter.  But I assure you I'm not your enemy."
5949,189,17,1,"You'll forgive me, Minister.  But it's a little hard to tell the difference these days."
5950,189,17,51,Dumbledore said something very similar the last time we spoke.
5951,189,17,3,"Where is your guard, sir?"
5952,189,17,51,I came alone.  I don't really need them anymore...
5953,190,17,11,We want you to be the godfather.
5954,190,17,1,You mean -- But that's brilliant -- I... don't know what to say.
5955,190,17,11,Say yes.
5956,190,17,25,"Hello, Harry!"
5957,190,17,25,"Oh, I've interrupted a deep thought, haven't I?  I can see it growing smaller in your eyes."
5958,190,17,1,"No, 'course not.  How are you, Luna?"
5959,190,17,25,Very well.  I was bitten by a garden gnome only moments ago.
5960,190,17,34,Gnome saliva is enormously beneficial!  Xenophilius Lovegood. We live just over the hill!
5961,190,17,1,"Nice to meet you, sir."
5962,190,17,34,"I trust you know, Mr. Potter, that we at The Quibbler, unlike those toadies at the Daily Prophet, fully supported Dumbledore during his lifetime and in his death support you just as fully."
5963,190,17,25,"Come, Daddy.  Harry doesn't want to talk to us right now.  He's just too nice to say so."
5964,190,17,1,Sir?  May I sit down?
5965,190,17,62,Mr. Potter!  By all means!
5966,190,17,1,"I found what you wrote in the Daily Prophet very moving, sir.  I take it you knew Professor Dumbledore well?"
5967,190,17,62,"I certainly knew him the longest, if you don't count his brother Aberforth -- and somehow, people never do seem to count Aberforth."
5968,190,17,1,"I never even knew he had a brother, sir."
5969,190,17,62,"Yes, well, Dumbledore was always very private.  Even as a boy."
5970,190,17,1,"Sir, I was wondering if you'd had much contact with him before he died."
5971,190,17,62,The occasional owl.  Though it was strange...
5972,190,17,1,"Strange, sir?"
5973,190,17,62,It was the owls themselves.  They often arrived in distress.  It was clear they'd traveled great distances in some cases.
5974,190,17,1,"Could you tell me from where they'd come, sir?"
5975,190,17,62,"I'm afraid not.  Albus' messages mostly referenced our days together as schoolboys.  They were surprisingly intimate.  When he did speak of his current activities his words would turn elliptical.  Still, I sensed he was under great stress.  Why do you ask?"
5976,190,17,1,Just curious.  I was... close to Professor Dumbledore.
5977,190,17,62,"Well, he treasured you, Mr. Potter, I can attest to that.  I can also tell you that when a person passes, it's only natural to rue the things left unsaid, to regret the question never asked. I knew Albus nigh on 100 years, but in many ways he will always remain a riddle even to me."
5978,190,17,140,"Don't despair, Elphias.  I'm told he's been thoroughly unriddled by Rita Skeeter.  In 800 pages no less."
5979,190,17,62,"That woman is a vulture, Muriel, and you well know it."
5980,190,17,77,"Someone has to pick the bones to get at the truth.  I read your obituary, Elphias.  Lovely.  But you did skate over some of the sticky patches in Dumbledore's life."
5981,190,17,62,"I'm sorry you think so, Muriel.  I assure you I was writing from the heart."
5982,190,17,77,"Yes, well, Rita Skeeter hasn't made that mistake, I'm sure.  Word has it someone talked to her, someone who knew the Dumbledore family well.  You and I both know who that is, Elphias."
5983,190,17,62,A monstrous betrayal.  I can only conclude the rumors are true and that she has become untethered.
5984,190,17,1,Who are you talking about?
5985,190,17,77,"Well, I don't suppose it'll be a secret once the book comes out. Bathilda Bagshot."
5986,190,17,1,Who?
5987,190,17,77,"Who? Bathilda Bagshot!  My god, boy, she's only the most celebrated magical historian of the last century.  Don't they read History of Magic at Hogwarts anymore?"
5988,190,17,1,"Oh, right.  Slipped my mind..."
5989,190,17,77,"She knew the Dumbledores as well as anyone.  She'd have letters, perhaps an interesting photograph or two.  I'm sure Rita Skeeter would have thought it well worth a trip to Godric's Hollow to take a peek into that old bird's rattled cage."
5990,190,17,1,Godric's Hollow?  Bathilda Bagshot lives in Godric's Hollow?
5991,190,17,77,For years now.  That's where she first met Dumbledore.
5992,190,17,1,Excuse me?  You don't mean to say Dumbledore lived there too?
5993,190,17,77,"Of course.  The family moved there after his father killed those three Muggles.  It was quite the scandal. Honestly, my boy, are you sure you knew him at all?"
5994,190,17,56,The Ministry has fallen.  The Minister of Magic is dead.  They are coming...
5995,190,17,62,"Nice meeting you, Mr. Potter!"
5996,190,17,3,Ron!  Ron!
5997,190,17,11,Harry!  Go!  Go!
5998,191,7,2,Where are we?
5999,191,7,3,Shaftesbury Avenue.  I used to come here to the theater with my mum and dad.  Just popped into my head.  I don't know why...
6000,191,7,3,This way!
6001,191,7,3,We need to change.
6002,191,7,2,How the ruddy --
6003,191,7,3,Undetectable Extension Charm.
6004,191,7,2,"You're amazing, you are."
6005,191,7,3,Always the tone of surprise.
6006,191,7,3,That'll be the books.
6007,191,7,1,Do you reckon everyone's alright at the wedding?  Maybe we should --
6008,191,7,2,"They were after you, mate.  We'd just put everyone in danger going back."
6009,191,7,3,"Ron's right.  Cappuccino, please."
6010,191,7,2,What she said.
6011,191,7,1,Same.
6012,191,7,140,Wicked scar.
6013,191,7,2,So where do we go from here?  The Leaky Cauldron?
6014,191,7,3,"Too dangerous.  If Voldemort's taken over the Ministry, none of the old places are safe."
6015,191,7,1,My rucksack.  With all my things. I left it back at the Burrow --
6016,191,7,1,You're joking.
6017,191,7,3,I've had the essentials packed for days.  Just in case.
6018,191,7,2,By the way -- these jeans?  Not my favorite.  Bit tight.
6019,191,7,1,Down!
6020,191,7,1,Stupefy!
6021,191,7,3,Petrificus Totalus! Go.
6022,191,7,3,She doesn't argue.
6023,191,7,1,"Lock the door, get the lights."
6024,191,7,1,This one's name is Rowle.  He was on the Astronomy Tower the night Snape killed Dumbledore.
6025,191,7,2,This is Dolohov.  I recognize him from the wanted posters.
6026,191,7,2,"So what do we do with you, huh? Kill us if it was turned round, wouldn't you?"
6027,191,7,2,Suppose it's him that did Mad-Eye. How would you feel then?
6028,191,7,1,"It's better we wipe their memories.  We kill them, they'll know we were here."
6029,191,7,2,You're the boss. Hermione?
6030,191,7,2,You're the best with spells.
6031,191,7,3,Obliviate.
6032,191,7,1,How is it they knew we were there?
6033,191,7,3,Maybe you still have the Trace on you.
6034,191,7,2,Can't be. The Trace breaks at seventeen. It's Wizarding law.
6035,191,7,2,What?
6036,191,7,3,"We didn't celebrate your birthday, Harry.  Ginny and I -- we'd prepared a cake.  We were going to bring it out at the end of the wedding..."
6037,191,7,1,Hermione.  I appreciate the thought -- honestly.  But given that we were almost killed by a couple of Death Eaters a few minutes ago...
6038,191,7,3,Right.  Perspective.
6039,191,7,2,"We've got to get off the streets, get somewhere safe."
6040,191,7,1,I have an idea.
6041,191,7,13,Severus Snape?
6042,191,7,1,Mad-Eye...?
6043,191,7,2,What was that about?
6044,191,7,3,"Mad-eye's doing, I'd guess.  In case Snape decided to come snooping."
6045,191,7,3,Homenum revelio.
6046,191,7,3,It's a spell to reveal human presence.
6047,191,7,3,We're alone.
6048,191,7,1,Lumos.
6049,191,7,45,Dear Sirius.  Thank you for Harry's birthday present.  You'd think he'd been born on a broom.
6050,191,7,45,"James says he's got the look of a Seeker, but then James would.  We had a very quiet birthday tea, just us and old Bathilda, who dotes on Harry.  Wormy dropped by late in the day, but seemed down and didn't stay long.  James is frustrated being shut up here, but Dumbledore's still got his Invisibility Cloak, so he doesn't have much choice.  By the way, Bathilda tells the most amazing stories about our old Headmaster. I don't know how much to believe. Can it really be true that Dumbledore --"
6051,191,7,3,Harry!  Harry!
6052,191,7,3,Ron!  I've found him!
6053,191,7,2,Good!  Tell him from me he's a git!
6054,191,7,3,"Harry, you can't just disappear. We thought --"
6055,191,7,3,It's from your Mum.  To Sirius. Bathilda Bagshot...?
6056,191,7,1,"Yeah.  They knew her.  She wrote A History of Magic, you know."
6057,191,7,3,Did she now?
6058,191,7,1,I'm thinking maybe we should go talk to her.  She still lives in Godric's Hollow.  I'm thinking maybe she could help us.
6059,191,7,3,"Harry.  I can imagine why you'd want to go there, but... I don't think Bathilda Bagshot is going to know where Voldemort hid his Horcruxes."
6060,191,7,2,Hey!  I think you two better come down here.
6061,191,7,2,"The two clinging to the tree are Death Eaters for sure.  Dunno 'bout the bloke on the bench. Can't see us, of course.  But we'll have to be careful coming and going.  C'mon.  There's something else you need to see."
6062,191,7,3,Lovely.
6063,191,7,1,To the Dark Lord.  I know I will be dead long before you read this... I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it...
6064,191,7,2,R.A.B. was Sirius' brother?
6065,191,7,3,"Yes.  Question is, did he actually destroy the real Horcrux?"
6066,192,7,1,Stop!  I order you!
6067,192,7,2,Kreacher...
6068,192,7,1,"Been spying on us, have you?"
6069,192,7,48,Kreacher has been... watching. Kreacher always watches.
6070,192,7,3,Maybe he knows.
6071,192,7,1,Ever seen this before?
6072,192,7,1,"Kreacher, I own this place. Sirius left it to me.  Which means I own you too."
6073,192,7,48,That was Master Regulus' locket.
6074,192,7,1,"That's right.  But there were two, weren't there?"
6075,192,7,1,Where's the other one?
6076,192,7,48,Kreacher doesn't know where the other locket is.
6077,192,7,3,But was it here?  Did you ever see it?
6078,192,7,48,Filthy Mudblood -- The Death Eaters will soon be coming for you!
6079,192,7,48,Blood-traitor Weasley --
6080,192,7,3,Ron!  RON!
6081,192,7,1,Answer her.
6082,192,7,48,"Yes.  It was here, in this house. A most evil object..."
6083,192,7,1,How do you mean?
6084,192,7,48,"Before he died, Master Regulus ordered Kreacher to destroy it. It was the last thing he asked of Kreacher.  But no matter how Kreacher tried, he could not.."
6085,192,7,1,"Where is it now?  Did someone take it, Kreacher?"
6086,192,7,48,"He came in the night.  He took many things, including the locket."
6087,192,7,1,"Who, Kreacher?  Who was it?"
6088,192,7,48,Mundungus.  Mundungus Fletcher.
6089,192,7,1,Find him.
6090,192,7,96,"As your new Minister for Magic, I promise to restore this temple of tolerance to its former glory. Therefore, beginning today, each employee will be required to submit themselves for evaluation. But know this:  You have nothing to fear... as long as you have nothing to hide..."
6091,192,7,71,My father will hear about this.
6092,192,7,10,"He's not here, you fools."
6093,192,7,3,They have flesh memories.
6094,192,7,3,"Snitches.  They're never touched by bare skin until the Seeker captures it.  Even the wizard who fabricates it wears gloves.  That way, if there's a dispute, the Snitch can identify who first touched it."
6095,192,7,1,You mean... it remembers me?
6096,192,7,3,"When Scrimgeour first gave it to you, I thought it might open at your touch -- that Dumbledore had hidden something in it."
6097,193,7,27,Harry Potter!  So long it's been --
6098,193,7,3,Expelliarmus!
6099,193,7,48,"As requested, Kreacher has returned with the thief Mundungus Fletcher!"
6100,193,7,27,Dobby has also returned with the thief Mundungus Fletcher!
6101,193,7,76,What are you playing at -- setting a pair of bleedin' 'ouse-elves on me!
6102,193,7,27,"Dobby was only trying to help! Dobby saw Kreacher in Diagon Alley, which Dobby thought was curious.  And then Dobby heard Kreacher mention Harry Potter's name, which Dobby thought was very curious.  And then Dobby saw that Kreacher was talking to the thief Mundungus Fletcher, which Dobby thought was very, very --"
6103,193,7,76,"I'm no thief, you foul little git. I'm a purveyer of rare and wondrous objects --"
6104,193,7,2,"You're a thief, Dung.  Everyone knows it."
6105,193,7,27,Master Weasley!  So good to see you again!
6106,193,7,2,Wicked trainers.
6107,193,7,76,"Listen, I panicked that night, all right?  I never volunteered to die for you, mate.  Can I help it if Mad-Eye fell off his broom --"
6108,193,7,3,Stop lying!
6109,193,7,2,Piece of advice.  Let's not rehash old times.  Got it... mate?
6110,193,7,1,"When you turned this place over -- don't deny it! -- you found a locket, am I right?"
6111,193,7,76,Why?  Was it valuable?
6112,193,7,3,You've still got it.
6113,193,7,2,No.  He's worried he should have got more money for it.
6114,193,7,76,"Wouldn't be difficult, would it? Bleedin' gave it away, din' I? There I was, pitching me wares in Diagon Alley when some ministry hag comes up and asks to see my license.  Says she's of a mind to lock me up and would've, too, she hadn' taken a fancy to that locket."
6115,193,7,1,Who was she?  This witch?
6116,193,7,76,"Well, she's right there, in't she? Bleedin' bow an' all."
6117,194,70,2,Right. So let's do it.  Who gets who?
6118,194,70,3,"Well, unless one of you fancies wearing a skirt..."
6119,194,70,3,Remember what we said.  Keep your eyes down.  Don't speak to anyone unless absolutely necessary.  Act as normal as possible.  Just do what you see everyone else doing. We do that -- and with a bit of luck -- we get ourselves inside. And then...
6120,194,70,1,It gets really tricky.
6121,194,70,3,Correct.
6122,194,70,1,This is completely mental.
6123,194,70,3,"Completely, utterly, without question."
6124,194,70,2,"The world's mental.  Come on, drink up.  We've got a Horcrux to find."
6125,194,70,2,"In case you're interested, I'm Reg Cattermole, Magical Maintenance Department."
6126,194,70,3,"Mafalda Hopkirk, assistant in the Improper Use of Magic Office."
6127,194,70,1,I'm nobody.
6128,194,70,3,You're somebody.  Be careful.
6129,194,70,135,"Morning, Reg!  Good luck today."
6130,194,70,2,Oh... yeah.  Thanks.
6131,194,70,2,What do you reckon he meant by 'Good luck.'?
6132,194,70,1,Apparently so.
6133,194,70,2,That's bloody disgusting.
6134,194,70,1,Are those...?
6135,194,70,3,Muggles.  In their rightful place.
6136,194,70,135,"Move it, will you -- oh, Runcorn! Forgive me..."
6137,194,70,3,You appear to be quite popular.
6138,194,70,2,"I gotta tell you, I'm starting to freak out a bit."
6139,194,70,1,The Ministry must be hiring young these days.
6140,194,70,2,They're not Ministry.  They're Snatchers.  They hunt Muggle-borns and blood-traitors for a price.
6141,194,70,1,"How long did you say this batch of Polyjuice Potion would last, Hermione?"
6142,194,70,3,I didn't.
6143,194,70,70,Cattlemole!
6144,194,70,70,It's still raining in my office. Two days now.
6145,194,70,2,Really?  Have you tried an umbrella?
6146,194,70,70,"You do realize I'm on my way downstairs, don't you, Cattermole?"
6147,194,70,2,Downstairs...?
6148,194,70,70,"To interrogate your wife!  If my wife's blood status were in doubt and the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement needed a job doing, I think I'd make it a priority.  You've got one hour."
6149,194,70,2,Oh my god.  What am I going to do? My wife's all alone downstairs?
6150,194,70,1,Ron.  You don't have a wife.
6151,194,70,1,"Look, we'll go with you --"
6152,194,70,2,"No, that's mad.  You two find Umbridge.  I'll be fine.  But how do I stop it raining?"
6153,194,70,3,Try Finite Incantatem.  Of course if something's gone wrong with an Atmospheric Charm --
6154,194,70,140,"Level Two.  Department of Magical Law Enforcement, including Wizengamot Administration Services, Auror Headquarters and Improper Use of Magic Department."
6155,194,70,3,This is you.
6156,194,70,2,"Finite Incantatem, okay.  And if that doesn't work...?"
6157,194,70,3,I don't like him being on his own down there.
6158,194,70,1,Ron's been coming here since he was two years old.  It's us you should be worrying about.
6159,194,70,3,"You really have horrible teeth, you know that."
6160,194,70,1,"I say if we don't locate Umbridge within the hour, we go find Ron and come back another day.  Deal?"
6161,194,70,15,"Ah, Mafalda!  Travers sent you, did he?  Good.  We'll go straight down."
6162,194,70,37,"Oh, yes... of course."
6163,194,70,132,Reckon the old hag will be interrogating Mudbloods all day?
6164,194,70,96,Sh...careful.
6165,194,70,15,Runcorn.
6166,194,70,1,Accio locket.
6167,194,70,135,"All right, all right.  Let's calm down, shall we?"
6168,194,70,135,It probably just snuck up here from Experimental Charms.  I think none of us will soon forget last month's Poisonous Duck...
6169,194,70,135,R-Runcorn.
6170,194,70,2,M-morning.
6171,194,70,1,"Ron, it's me."
6172,194,70,2,"Harry!  Blimey, I forgot what you looked like.  Where's Hermione?"
6173,194,70,1,She went down to the courtrooms with Umbridge --
6174,194,70,16,"I understand, Wakinda, but I can't be a party to that."
6175,194,70,16,"Hello, Reg.  Isn't Mary in for questioning today?  Try to have faith.  If there's anything Molly and I can do for you --"
6176,194,70,140,Let me guess.  It's raining in Yaxley's office again?
6177,194,70,16,Tell him to try an umbrella.
6178,194,70,1,"Arthur!  You know you're being tracked, don't you?"
6179,194,70,16,"Is that a threat, Runcorn?"
6180,194,70,1,"No, Arthur.  It's a fact.  They're watching you."
6181,194,70,1,I'll tell you later.  Let's find Hermione.
6182,194,70,2,Bloody cold down here.
6183,194,70,139,"I'm half-blood, I tell you!  My father was a wizard!  Look him up! William Alderton!  He worked here for thirty years..."
6184,194,70,2,What is it?
6185,194,70,1,It's here...
6186,194,70,83,Reg...
6187,194,70,15,Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?
6188,194,70,83,Yes.
6189,194,70,15,"Mother to Maisie, Ellie and Alfred?  Wife to Reginald?"
6190,194,70,83,Yes.
6191,194,70,15,"A wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the Ministry today, Mrs. Cattermole.  Is this that wand?"
6192,194,70,15,Would you please tell the court from which witch or wizard you took this wand.
6193,194,70,83,"But I didn't take it.  I got it in Diagon Alley, at Ollivander's, when I was eleven.  It chose me."
6194,194,70,15,"No, no, I don't think so, Mrs. Cattermole.  Wands only choose witches.  And you are not a witch."
6195,194,70,83,"But I am!  Tell them, Reg!  Tell them what I am!"
6196,194,70,15,"What the devil are you doing, Albert?"
6197,194,70,1,"You're lying.  And one mustn't tell lies, Dolores... Stupefy!"
6198,194,70,1,Expecto PATRONUM!
6199,194,70,3,Relashio!
6200,194,70,83,"You?  It's you! Reg, it's Harry Potter!"
6201,194,70,2,"'Tis, isn't it?  This'll be one to tell the kids."
6202,194,70,135,Harry Potter...?
6203,194,70,3,Harry... they've seen you.  We've got to get out of here.
6204,194,70,2,"Mary.  Go home.  Get the kids. I'll... I'll meet you there.  We have to get out the country, understand?"
6205,194,70,2,Mary!  Do as I say!
6206,194,70,2,I'm sorry.  It's just --
6207,194,70,2,Long story.  Nice meeting you.
6208,194,70,2,Piss off.
6209,194,70,70,Seal the exits!  Now!
6210,195,74,3,"Harry, quickly, in my bag, there's a small bottle labeled 'Essence of Dittany.'"
6211,195,74,3,Quickly!
6212,195,74,1,Accio Dittany.
6213,195,74,3,Unstopper it.
6214,195,74,1,Hermione.  His arm --
6215,195,74,3,Just do it!
6216,195,74,1,What happened?  I thought we were going back to Grimmauld Place.
6217,195,74,3,"We were.  We were there.  But Yaxley had hold of me.  I knew we couldn't stay once he'd seen, so when he let go I brought us here. Ron got Splinched.  I'm... sorry."
6218,195,74,1,Don't be stupid.
6219,195,74,3,It's all I feel safe doing.
6220,195,74,3,Salvio Hexia... Protego Totalum...
6221,195,74,1,What're you doing?
6222,195,74,3,"Protective enchantments.  I don't fancy another visit like we had on Shaftesbury Avenue, do you? Especially with Ron like this. You can get going on the tent..."
6223,195,74,1,Tent?  Where am I supposed to find --
6224,195,74,3,Repello Muggletum... Muffliato...
6225,195,74,3,How're the mushrooms?  Seem to be the only edible things growing round here.
6226,195,74,1,They're great.
6227,195,74,3,Make sure to leave some for Ron.
6228,195,74,1,No problem.
6229,195,74,1,How bad is he?
6230,195,74,3,"He'll be alright in a few days. Hopefully.  If we could take him to Hogwarts, to Madam Pomfrey --"
6231,195,74,3,So where do we go next?
6232,195,74,1,"Dumbledore had a theory.  He felt that the Horcruxes would not be made out of random objects.  And he felt they wouldn't be hidden randomly either.  We know of three so far.  The ring, which according to Dumbledore belonged to Tom Riddle's grandfather.  The diary, which belonged to Tom himself. And this, which -- again, according to Dumbledore -- belonged to his mother."
6233,195,74,3,"It scares me a bit, that, thinking it's a piece of Vol--"
6234,195,74,2,"No, don't!  Don't say it!"
6235,195,74,2,It's taboo -- You-Know-Who's name. That's how they track people now. It's how they found us in the cafe that night.
6236,195,74,1,How d'you know?
6237,195,74,2,"I overheard a bloke from the Enforcement office talking about it at the Ministry.  Blimey, what's that smell?"
6238,195,74,3,Dinner?
6239,195,74,2,Not bloody likely.  Smells like something Ginny would cook.
6240,195,74,3,Tea?
6241,195,74,2,Is that it?
6242,195,74,1,"I know.  I felt it too. It's... it's like it's ticking or something, like it has a tiny metal heart, like it's --"
6243,195,74,2,... alive.
6244,195,74,3,I hate it.  It's like he's here with us.
6245,195,74,1,That's why we're going to kill it.
6246,195,74,1,Dissendium!
6247,195,74,3,Incendio!
6248,195,74,1,Expulso!
6249,195,74,3,Confringo!
6250,195,74,2,It's angry.
6251,195,74,3,What're you doing?
6252,195,74,1,We have to keep it safe until we can figure out how to destroy it.
6253,195,74,3,I can put it in my bag --
6254,195,74,1,No.
6255,195,74,2,"Seems strange, mate.  Dumbledore sends you off to find a load of Horcruxes, but doesn't bother to tell you how to destroy them. Doesn't that bother you?"
6256,195,74,9,"You wouldn't be lying to me, would you, Gregorovitch?  Because, I must tell you... that will only make it worse for you..."
6257,195,74,9,Who was he?  The thief?
6258,195,74,125,Just a boy!  Not of the village. It was he who took it.  I never saw it again.  I swear on my life.
6259,195,74,9,I believe you...
6260,195,74,3,I thought it had stopped.
6261,195,74,3,"You can't let him in, Harry. Dumbledore himself said it.  You have to close your mind.  It's too dangerous --"
6262,195,74,1,"It's not a candle I can blow out, Hermione.  It always burns, even if it's just a flicker.  Can you understand that?"
6263,195,74,3,Tell me. What you saw.
6264,195,74,1,He's found him.  Vol--
6265,195,74,1,You-Know-Who.  He's found Gregorovitch --
6266,195,74,3,The wandmaker?
6267,195,74,1,Yes.  How'd you know?
6268,195,74,3,Viktor got his wand from Gregorovitch.  Most Durmstrang students did at one time.  What's he got to do with You-Know-Who?
6269,195,74,1,You-Know-Who wants something Gregorovitch once had -- dunno what.  But he's desperate to have it.  It's as if his life depends on it.
6270,195,74,3,Don't -- It... comforts him.
6271,195,74,1,Well it sets my teeth on edge. What's he expecting to hear?  Good news?
6272,195,74,3,I think he just hopes he doesn't hear bad news.  It gets him through the day.
6273,195,74,1,And what gets you through the day?
6274,195,74,3,"We've all made sacrifices, Harry."
6275,195,74,1,How long before he can travel?
6276,195,74,3,I don't know.  It takes time.  I'm doing all I can.
6277,195,74,1,You're not doing enough.
6278,195,74,3,Take it off.
6279,195,74,3,Take it off.  Now.
6280,195,74,3,Better?
6281,195,74,1,Loads.
6282,195,74,3,It's cold.  Even though it's been lying against your skin for days.
6283,195,74,3,We'll take turns.  Okay?
6284,196,74,53,What's that?  That... smell?
6285,196,74,1,Snatchers.
6286,196,74,1,Good to know your enchantments work.
6287,196,74,3,He could smell it.  My perfume.
6288,197,74,1,We have to leave.  We're not safe here.
6289,197,74,3,I told you.  Ron's not strong enough to Apparate.
6290,197,74,1,Then we'll go by foot.
6291,197,74,2,I'm hungry.
6292,197,74,1,We're all hungry.
6293,197,74,2,Leave it.
6294,197,74,2,Mum can make food appear out of thin air.
6295,197,74,3,No one can conjure food out of thin air.  Food is the first of the five Principal Exceptions to Gamp's Law.  The other four are --
6296,197,74,2,"Oh, speak English, can't you?"
6297,197,74,2,I said leave it.
6298,197,74,1,It'll be dark soon.  We need to find a place to sleep.
6299,197,74,3,Good plan.
6300,197,74,2,"Yeah.  Brilliant.  Only, correct me if I'm wrong... wasn't that yesterday's plan?  And the day before that?  And the day before that?  Walk.  Sleep.  Walk. Sleep."
6301,197,74,1,My turn.
6302,197,74,2,"He doesn't know what he's doing, does he?"
6303,197,74,3,None of us do.
6304,197,74,2,Wizards were here.
6305,197,74,3,I don't like this place.
6306,197,74,3,I want to go.
6307,197,74,3,I'll tell you in a minute.
6308,197,74,1,Maybe you could tell me now.
6309,197,74,3,Alright.  The Sword of Gryffindor? It's Goblin made.
6310,197,74,1,Brilliant.
6311,197,74,3,You don't understand.  Dirt and rust have no effect on the blade. It only takes in that which makes it stronger.
6312,197,74,1,O-kay.
6313,197,74,3,"Harry.  You already destroyed one Horcrux, right?  Tom Riddle's diary -- in the Chamber of Secrets."
6314,197,74,1,With a basilisk fang.  If you tell me you've got one of those in that bloody beaded bag of yours --
6315,197,74,3,"Don't you see!  In the Chamber of Secrets, you stabbed the basilisk with the Sword of Gryffindor."
6316,197,74,3,Its blade is impregnated with basilisk venom.
6317,197,74,1,It only takes in that which makes it stronger...
6318,197,74,3,Exactly!  Which means...
6319,197,74,1,... it can destroy Horcruxes.
6320,197,74,3,Which is why Dumbledore left it to you in his will.
6321,197,74,1,"You're brilliant, Hermione. Truly."
6322,197,74,3,"Actually, I'm highly logical, which allows me to look past the extraneous detail and perceive clearly that which others overlook."
6323,197,74,1,There's only one problem...
6324,197,74,2,The sword was stolen.
6325,197,74,2,"Yeah, I'm still here.  But you two carry on.  Don't let me spoil your fun."
6326,197,74,1,What's the problem?
6327,197,74,2,"Problem?  There's no problem.  Not according to you, anyway."
6328,197,74,1,"Look, don't be shy.  If you've got something to say, spit it out."
6329,197,74,2,"All right, I'll spit it out. Don't expect me to skip up and down because now there's some other damn thing we've got to find."
6330,197,74,3,Ron...
6331,197,74,1,I thought you knew what you signed up for.
6332,197,74,2,"Yeah, I thought I did too."
6333,197,74,1,I don't understand.  What part of this isn't living up to your expectations?  Did you think we'd be staying in five-star hotels? Finding a Horcrux every other day? Did you think you'd be back to Mummy by Christmas?
6334,197,74,2,"No, I just reckoned after all this time, we'd have actually achieved something.  I reckoned you knew what you were doing.  I reckoned Dumbledore had told you something worthwhile! I reckoned you had a plan!"
6335,197,74,1,"I've told you everything Dumbledore told me! And in case you haven't noticed, we've found a Horcrux!"
6336,197,74,2,"Yeah, and we're about as near getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them, aren't we!"
6337,197,74,3,"Take it off, Ron.  Please take it off.  You wouldn't be talking like this if you hadn't been wearing it all day --"
6338,197,74,1,"Yeah, he would.  D'you think I haven't noticed the two of you whispering behind my back?  D'you think I haven't guessed what you were thinking?"
6339,197,74,3,"Harry, we weren't --"
6340,197,74,2,"Don't lie!  You said it, too, you said you were disappointed --"
6341,197,74,3,I didn't!  Not like that!  Harry -- I didn't!
6342,197,74,2,"Do you know why I listen to that radio, every night?  Do you!  To make sure I don't hear Ginny's name or Fred or George or Mum or --"
6343,197,74,1,You think I don't listen!  You think I don't know what it's like --
6344,197,74,3,Stop!  Stop!
6345,197,74,1,Go then.  But leave that.
6346,197,74,2,And you?
6347,197,74,3,Me?
6348,197,74,2,Are you staying?  Or coming?
6349,197,74,2,"Fine.  I get it.  I saw you two the other night.  Yeah, that's right.  Didn't know I knew, did you?"
6350,197,74,3,"What?  Ron, no -- please --"
6351,197,74,3,He's gone.
6352,198,74,1,Salvio Hexia... Protego Totalum...
6353,198,74,3,It's a Muggle station.
6354,198,74,1,You were right.  It's like you said.  Snitches have flesh memories.  But I didn't catch my first Snitch with my hand.  I almost swallowed it.
6355,198,74,3,'I open at the close?'
6356,198,74,1,What do you reckon it means?
6357,198,74,3,"I don't know.  But look, I've found something as well..."
6358,198,74,3,"I thought it was a picture of an eye, but now I don't think it is. It isn't a rune and it's not in Spellman's Syllabary either.  And it's been inked in -- somebody drew it -- it isn't part of the book."
6359,198,74,1,"Luna's dad was wearing that, at Ron- At Bill and Fleur's wedding."
6360,198,74,3,What d'you mean -- wearing it?
6361,198,74,1,Around his neck.  Like an amulet. I didn't think much of it at the time.  You know Luna -- she's always got some mad thing or the other she's carrying around.  I just figured it ran in the family.
6362,198,74,3,Why would someone have drawn it in a children's book?
6363,198,74,1,"Hermione, I've been thinking.  I -- I want to go to Godric's Hollow. It's where I was born, it's where my parents died --"
6364,198,74,3,And it's exactly where You-Know- Who will expect you to go. Because it means something to you.
6365,198,74,1,"But it means something to him too, Hermione.  You-Know-Who nearly died there.  Wouldn't that be just the kind of place he'd hide a Horcrux?"
6366,198,74,3,"It's dangerous, Harry.  But I have to admit, recently even I've been thinking we might have to go.  I think it's possible something else is hidden there. The sword.  If Dumbledore didn't want it falling into the Ministry's hands, but wanted you to find it, what better place to hide it than the birthplace of the founder of Gryffindor himself?"
6367,198,74,1,"Godric's Hollow is the birthplace of Godric Gryffindor -- I mean, 'course it is.  Obvious, isn't it?"
6368,198,74,3,"Harry, did you ever even open A History of Magic?"
6369,198,74,1,Tossed it at Neville once when he was snoring -- might've popped open.
6370,198,74,1,Hermione...
6371,198,74,3,Don't ever let me give you a haircut again.
6372,199,9,3,I still think we should've used Polyjuice Potion.
6373,199,9,1,No.  This is where I was born. I'm not returning as someone else.
6374,199,9,3,"Harry, I think it's Christmas Eve! Listen..."
6375,199,9,1,Do you think they'd be in there? My mum and dad?
6376,199,9,3,Yeah. I think they would.
6377,199,9,3,Harry.
6378,199,9,1,Is it -- ?
6379,199,9,3,No.  But look.
6380,199,9,3,Did you know he had a sister?
6381,199,9,1,No.
6382,199,9,3,Lumos.
6383,199,9,3,"Ignotus... Hey, Har --"
6384,199,9,1,"Happy Christmas, Hermione."
6385,199,9,3,"Happy Christmas, Harry."
6386,199,9,3,Harry...
6387,199,9,1,Yeah.
6388,199,9,3,Someone's watching us.  By the gate.
6389,199,9,1,C'mon.
6390,199,9,3,I don't think this is a good idea.
6391,199,9,1,We look like ordinary Muggles.
6392,199,9,3,Muggles who've just been laying flowers on your parents' grave.
6393,199,9,1,Relax.  This is right.  I know it.
6394,199,9,3,Omigod.  Harry...
6395,199,9,1,"This is where they died, Hermione. This is where he murdered them."
6396,200,9,1,"You're Bathilda, aren't you?"
6397,200,9,3,"Harry, I'm not sure about this."
6398,200,9,1,"Hermione, she knew Dumbledore. She might have the sword. Besides, she's barely knee-high to a house-elf.  I think we can overpower her if it turns ugly."
6399,200,9,3,There's something odd about her. And what's that smell?
6400,200,9,1,"She's gaga, remember?"
6401,200,9,1,Here.  Let me do that.
6402,200,9,3,"You have a lovely house, Miss Bagshot."
6403,200,9,1,Miss Bagshot?  Who is this man?
6404,200,9,1,His name.  Can you tell me his name?
6405,200,9,1,"This is him, Hermione.  The one I saw in Gregorovitch's wandshop. The thief.  Miss Bagshot, who is he?"
6406,200,9,1,She wants us to go upstairs.
6407,200,9,3,All right...
6408,200,9,1,She wants me to go.  Alone.
6409,200,9,3,Why?
6410,200,9,1,It's all right.  You stay here.
6411,200,9,3,Harry...
6412,200,9,1,Lumos.
6413,200,9,104,You are Potter?
6414,200,9,1,Yes.
6415,200,9,104,I have something for you...
6416,200,9,3,Harry!
6417,200,9,3,Confringo!
6418,200,68,3,"Harry... Harry, can you hear me...?"
6419,200,68,1,Yes.
6420,200,68,3,Good.  That's good...
6421,200,68,1,We got away.
6422,200,68,3,Yes.
6423,200,68,1,Are you alright?
6424,200,68,3,I'm fine.  But you've been sick. Rest... Rest a bit more...
6425,200,68,1,You've outdone yourself this time.
6426,200,68,3,"The Forest of Dean.  I came here once with my mum and dad, years ago.  It's just how I remember it. The trees.  The river.  It's like nothing's changed.  Not true, of course.  Everything's changed.  If I brought my parents here, they wouldn't recognize any of it.  Not the trees.  Not the river.  Not... me."
6427,200,68,1,Where are they?
6428,200,68,3,"Wendell and Monica Wilkens now reside happily in Sydney, Australia.  They have two dogs, run a small sweet shop, but floss daily.  No children."
6429,200,68,3,"Maybe we should just stay here, Harry.  Grow old."
6430,200,68,3,"You wanted to know who the boy in the photograph was.  Well, I know."
6431,200,68,3,"It was in Bathilda's sitting room. Rita Skeeter had sent it to her. Harry, it doesn't make for very nice reading --"
6432,200,68,1,"Who is he, Hermione?  The thief? Did Dumbledore know him?"
6433,200,68,3,Yes.
6434,200,68,1,Well?
6435,200,68,3,For a time.
6436,200,68,1,"Tell me, Hermione.  Who is he?"
6437,200,68,3,"Gellert Grindelwald.  He's not very well known in Britain, but there was a time, before You-Know- Who..."
6438,200,68,1,"Hermione, I don't need to have read A History of Magic to know who Gellert Grindelwald is."
6439,200,68,3,"When Grindelwald was seventeen, he was expelled from Durmstrang. He'd started doing some twisted things at school -- experiments. A few teachers had always protected him, but they couldn't anymore.  After he left, he traveled for awhile, then ended up in Godric's Hollow where his great aunt lived, Bathilda Bagshot."
6440,200,68,1,"Get to the hard part, Hermione."
6441,200,68,3,"She introduced him to Dumbledore. It made sense.  Dumbledore's mother had just died, Grindelwald was troubled and they were both brilliant -- they'd never really had anyone they could talk to on the same level.  They did a lot of talking that summer.  But they always returned to one particular subject."
6442,200,68,3,Wizard rule over Muggles.
6443,200,68,1,And Dumbledore believed in it?
6444,200,68,3,Yes.
6445,200,68,1,'For the Greater Good.'  What does that mean?
6446,200,68,3,"It was something Dumbledore came up with.  He believed wizards were superior and should rule over Muggles, but gently, for their own good.  Grindelwald took a more violent position."
6447,200,68,3,"It was a different time, Harry. It was one summer.  Dumbledore was young --"
6448,200,68,1,"We're young, Hermione.  And here we are, risking our lives to fight against the very thing Dumbledore supported."
6449,200,68,3,"He changed, Harry.  Years later, it was Dumbledore who put Grindelwald in prison."
6450,200,68,1,Where's my wand?  I'll take the watch.
6451,200,68,1,Hermione.  Where's my wand?
6452,200,68,3,"It's my fault.  As we were leaving Godric's Hollow, I cast a curse and it rebounded... I'm sorry, Harry, I tried to mend it but wands are different --"
6453,200,68,1,It's done.
6454,200,68,3,Maybe we can --
6455,200,68,1,It's done.
6456,201,68,1,Leave me yours.  You get back in the warm.  And give me that.
6457,201,68,3,"He loved you, Harry.  I know he loved you."
6458,201,68,1,No...
6459,201,68,1,Lumos! Accio Sword.
6460,201,68,1,Diffindo.
6461,201,68,1,Hermione...
6462,201,68,2,Are -- you -- mental?
6463,201,68,1,It was you!
6464,201,68,2,"Well, yeah.  Bit obvious, I'd think."
6465,201,68,1,And the doe.  That was you as well.
6466,201,68,2,No.  I reckoned it was you.
6467,201,68,1,My Patronus is a stag.
6468,201,68,2,Right.  Antlers.
6469,201,68,1,You didn't see anyone else?
6470,201,68,2,"No, I... I did think maybe I saw something -- when I was running -- over there --"
6471,201,68,2,Anything?
6472,201,68,1,"But I reckon whoever cast the doe, put the sword in that pool hoping we'd find it."
6473,201,68,2,"And we did, didn't we?"
6474,201,68,1,See that?  It knows.  It's afraid. Do it.
6475,201,68,2,"What?  No.  Harry.  That thing's bad for me.  I can't handle it. I'm not making excuses for how I acted, but that thing affects me more than it affects you and Hermione.  It made me think stuff -- stuff I was thinking anyway, but it made everything worse."
6476,201,68,1,All the more reason.
6477,201,68,2,No.  I can't --
6478,201,68,1,Then why are you here?  Why did you come back?
6479,201,68,1,"I'll have to speak to it in order for it to open.  When it does, don't hesitate.  I don't know what's in here, but it'll put up a fight.  The bit of Riddle that was in his diary tried to kill me."
6480,201,68,1,On three.  One.  Two.  Three. Take me inside...
6481,201,68,1,"Stab it, Ron.  Now."
6482,201,68,9,I have seen your heart and it is mine...
6483,201,68,1,Don't listen to it.
6484,201,68,1,Ron.  Don't listen to it!
6485,201,68,1,Ron.  Stab it!
6486,201,68,1,"We were better without you, happier without you."
6487,201,68,3,"Who could look at you beside Harry Potter?  What are you, compared with the Chosen One...?"
6488,201,68,1,Ron.  It lies!  Stab it!  STAB IT!
6489,201,68,1,Your mother confessed that she would have preferred me as a son...
6490,201,68,3,"Who wouldn't prefer him, what woman would take you, you are nothing, nothing, nothing to him..."
6491,201,68,1,"Do it, Ron!  Kill it!"
6492,201,68,1,"After you left, she cried for a week.  She's like my sister."
6493,201,68,2,I'm sorry.  I'm sorry I left.
6494,201,68,1,You've sort of made up for it tonight.  Getting the sword. Finishing off the Horcrux.
6495,201,68,2,Saving your life.
6496,201,68,1,That too.
6497,201,68,2,And just think of it.  Only three to go.
6498,201,68,1,Hermione!
6499,201,68,3,Everything all right?
6500,201,68,1,Fine.  Actually... more than fine.
6501,201,68,2,Hey.
6502,201,68,2,Wo -- hey -- ouch!
6503,201,68,3,"You -- complete -- arse -- Ronald -- Weasley!  You crawl back here after all these weeks and say, 'Hey?' Where's my wand?  Harry, where's my wand!"
6504,201,68,1,Um... I don't know?
6505,201,68,3,"Harry Potter, you give me my wand!"
6506,201,68,2,How come he's got your wand?
6507,201,68,3,Never mind why he's got my wand --
6508,201,68,3,What is that?
6509,201,68,3,You destroyed it?
6510,201,68,1,It's a long story.
6511,201,68,3,Don't think this changes anything.
6512,201,68,2,"No, of course not.  I only destroyed a bloody freaking Horcrux!  Why would that change anything!  Do you know what it was like for me to hear those words coming from you!  To see you doing those things --"
6513,201,68,3,See me doing what things?
6514,201,68,3,What happened out there?
6515,201,68,1,It's a long story.
6516,202,68,2,"Look, I wanted to come back the minute I'd left.  I just... didn't know how to find you."
6517,202,68,1,Exactly how did you find us?
6518,202,68,2,With this.
6519,202,68,2,"It doesn't just turn off lights. I don't know exactly how it works, but Christmas morning I -- I was sleeping -- in this little pub-- I'd given some Snatchers the slip the night before, me being a blood- traitor and all -- anyway, I was sleeping when I heard it..."
6520,202,68,1,It?
6521,202,68,2,A voice.
6522,202,68,2,"Your voice, Hermione.  Coming out of this."
6523,202,68,3,And what may I ask did I say?
6524,202,68,2,My name.  Just my name.  Like a whisper.
6525,202,68,2,So I took this and I clicked it and this tiny ball of light appeared.  And I knew.
6526,202,68,1,Knew what?
6527,202,68,2,"Just knew.  On account of Hermione's voice.  And sure enough, it floated toward me, the ball of light, right to my chest and then -- went straight through -- right here."
6528,202,68,2,"I could feel it inside me.  It was warm, like the first sip of a good cup of tea.  And I knew it would take me where I needed to go."
6529,202,68,2,So I Disapparated and came out on this hillside.  It was dark.  I didn't have any idea where I was. I just had to hope one of you would show yourselves in the end. And you did.
6530,202,68,2,I've always liked it.  These flames Hermione makes.
6531,202,68,2,How long you reckon she'll stay mad at me?
6532,202,68,1,Keep talking 'bout that little ball of light touching your heart -- she'll come round.
6533,202,68,2,It was true.  Every word.
6534,202,68,2,"Bloody hell.  I just realized. You need a wand, right?"
6535,202,68,1,Yeah...
6536,202,68,2,"Well, I've got one.  Here.  It's Blackthorn, ten inches, nothing special, but I reckon it'll do.  I took it off a Snatcher a few weeks back."
6537,202,68,2,"Don't tell Hermione, but they're a bit dim, Snatchers.  This one was definitely part Troll.  The smell off him..."
6538,202,68,1,Engorgio.
6539,202,68,2,Wo.
6540,202,68,1,Reducio!
6541,202,68,3,What's going on in there?
6542,202,68,1,Nothing.
6543,202,68,2,Nothing.
6544,202,68,2,"Maybe a bit more practice, eh?"
6545,202,68,3,We need to talk.
6546,202,68,2,All right.
6547,202,68,3,I want to go and see Xenophilius Lovegood.
6548,202,68,1,Sorry?
6549,202,68,3,See this?  It's a letter Dumbledore wrote to Grindelwald. Look at the signature.  It's the mark again.
6550,202,68,3,It keeps cropping up.  Here.  In Beedle the Bard.  In the graveyard in Godric's Hollow -- what?
6551,202,68,1,Jesus.  It was there too.
6552,202,68,3,Where?
6553,202,68,1,Outside Gregorovitch's wand shop. on the alley wall...
6554,202,68,2,But what does it mean?
6555,202,68,3,"Harry, you don't have a clue where the next Horcrux is.  And neither do I.  But this, this means something.  I'm sure of it."
6556,202,68,2,I think Hermione's right.  I think we ought to go and see Lovegood. What say we vote on it?  Those in favor...
6557,202,68,2,"Sorry, Harry.  Looks like it's Hermione and me this time."
6558,202,68,1,"Not still mad at him, are you?"
6559,202,68,3,I'm always mad at him.
6560,203,12,2,Luna?
6561,203,12,1,Luna.
6562,203,12,3,Luna.
6563,203,12,2,Keep off the dirigible plums.
6564,203,12,34,What is it? Who are you? What do you want --
6565,203,12,1,"Hello, Mr. Lovegood.  I'm Harry Potter.  We met a few months back?"
6566,203,12,1,"Would it be okay if we came in? It won't take long, sir.  I promise."
6567,203,12,34,Excuse me.
6568,203,12,34,"So.  What brings you here, Mr. Potter?"
6569,203,12,1,"Well, sir, we need some help."
6570,203,12,34,"Ah.  Help.  I see.  Yes, well, the thing is, helping Harry Potter, rather dangerous these days..."
6571,203,12,2,Aren't you the one who keeps telling everyone it's their first duty to help Harry?
6572,203,12,34,"I have expressed that view, yes. In the past.  Would you excuse me one moment.  I shall return shortly and, um, try to help you..."
6573,203,12,1,What's going on here?
6574,203,12,2,"He's mental.  Let's face it. Luna's always good value, but she's nutty as squirrel poo."
6575,203,12,3,Do you see that?
6576,203,12,2,"Well, yeah, of course.  It's massive, isn't it?"
6577,203,12,3,No!  Don't go near it!
6578,203,12,3,It's an Erumpent horn.  It's a Class B Tradeable Material.
6579,203,12,2,"Yeah, all right..."
6580,203,12,34,May I offer you all an infusion of Gurdyroots? We make it ourselves.
6581,203,12,3,"Where is Luna, sir?"
6582,203,12,34,"Luna?  Oh, um, she'll be along. Now how can I help you, Mr. Potter?"
6583,203,12,1,"Well, sir, it's about something you were wearing around your neck at the wedding.  A symbol..."
6584,203,12,34,You mean this?
6585,203,12,1,"Yes!  Exactly.  What we wondered, sir, is, well, what is it?"
6586,203,12,34,"What is it?  Well, it's the sign of the Deathly Hallows, of course."
6587,203,12,1,The what?
6588,203,12,2,The what?
6589,203,12,3,The what?
6590,203,12,34,The Deathly Hallows.  I assume you're all familiar with 'The Tale of the Three Brothers?'
6591,203,12,3,Yes.
6592,203,12,2,Yes.
6593,203,12,1,No.
6594,203,12,3,It's in here.
6595,203,12,34,"Well, there's no real reason to go on unless one is familiar with the tale.  Why don't you read it aloud, Miss...?"
6596,203,12,3,"Granger.  Well... all right. There were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight --"
6597,203,12,2,Midnight.  Mum always said midnight. But twilight's fine.  Better actually.
6598,203,12,3,"In time, the brothers reached a river too treacherous to pass..."
6599,203,12,34,"Well, there you are.  Those are the Deathly Hallows."
6600,203,12,1,Sorry... I still don't really understand...
6601,203,12,34,The Elder Wand...
6602,203,12,34,The Resurrection Stone...
6603,203,12,34,... then encloses both in a TRIANGLE. The Cloak of Invisibility. Together... they make the Deathly Hallows.  Together... they make one master of Death.
6604,203,12,3,"Mr. Lovegood, does the Peverell family have anything to do with the Deathly Hallows?"
6605,203,12,34,Ignotus and his brothers Cadmus and Antioch are thought to be the original owners of the Hallows and therefore the inspiration for the story.
6606,203,12,34,"Ah, but your tea's grown cold. Excuse me, I'll be right back."
6607,204,12,2,"Let's get out of here once he's back.  I'm not touching this stuff, hot or cold."
6608,204,12,1,Which one would you choose if you could?  Of the Deathly Hallows?
6609,204,12,3,"It's obvious, isn't it?"
6610,204,12,2,The Wand.
6611,204,12,3,The Cloak.
6612,204,12,1,The Stone.
6613,204,12,2,"You're supposed to say the Cloak, but who wants to spend all day being invisible.  Dead boring if you ask me.  But an unbeatable wand!"
6614,204,12,3,Its owner grew drunk with power and was murdered.
6615,204,12,2,"Yeah, but imagine what a short wicked life you'd lead."
6616,204,12,3,"Why the Stone, Harry?"
6617,204,12,1,"Well, you could bring people back, couldn't you?  Mad-Eye. Dumbledore.  Sirius.  Anybody."
6618,204,12,3,But according to the story they don't want to come back.  It's all rubbish anyway.  There's no such thing as the Deathly Hallows.
6619,204,12,1,But I have one.  The Invisibility Cloak my father left me.
6620,204,12,3,There have always been Cloaks --
6621,204,12,2,Not like Harry's.  I've seen a fair few.  Dad used to bring home the ones the Ministry confiscated from petty thieves and the like. They always got holes or tears. Harry's is different.  It's perfect.
6622,204,12,1,"And I think I've actually held the Resurrection Stone in my hands, that night in Dumbledore's office when he showed me the ring he'd destroyed, the Horcrux.  It had a symbol on it.  Now I think it was the mark of the Hallows."
6623,204,12,3,"Mr. Lovegood.  Thank you, sir --"
6624,204,12,2,You forgot the water.
6625,204,12,34,The water?
6626,204,12,2,For the tea.
6627,204,12,34,"Did, didn't I?  How silly of me."
6628,204,12,3,"No matter, sir.  We really ought to be go--"
6629,204,12,34,"No, you mustn't --"
6630,204,12,1,Sir?
6631,204,12,34,"You're my only hope.  They were angry, you see, about what I'd been writing, so they took her. They took my Luna... But it's really you they want..."
6632,204,12,1,"Who took her, sir?"
6633,204,12,34,Him.  Surely you call him You-Know- Who.  But his real name of course is... Voldemort.
6634,204,12,2,Nooooooooo!
6635,204,12,34,Stop!  I've got him --
6636,204,12,3,Ron!  Harry!  Take my hand!
6637,204,68,2,That treacherous old bleeder!  Is there no one we can trust!
6638,204,68,1,They've kidnapped Luna because he supported me.  He was just desperate.
6639,204,68,2,I'll do the enchantments.
6640,204,68,53,"Hello, beautiful."
6641,204,68,98,"Ah, Tom, I thought you would come one day.  But surely you must know I no longer have what you seek..."
6642,204,68,9,"If not you, then who?"
6643,204,68,98,"You're so innocent, Tom.  Like a schoolboy.  There's so much you don't understand..."
6644,204,68,9,"Tell me, Grindelwald.  Tell me where to find it!  Tell me who possesses it!  The name, Grindelwald!  The name!"
6645,204,68,98,"Can't you guess, Tom?  It lies with him, of course.  Buried within the earth.  It is he who possesses it, even in death.  Your old friend and mine... Dumbledore."
6646,204,68,1,They exist.  The Hallows.
6647,204,68,1,"But he only wants the one, the last one.  That's what he's been looking for."
6648,204,68,3,What're you saying?
6649,204,68,1,"He knows where it is, You-Know- Who.  He'll have it by the end of the night.  He's found the Elder Wand."
6650,205,68,2,Don't touch her!
6651,205,68,3,Stop it!
6652,205,68,53,"Your boyfriend'll get worse than that if he doesn't behave, lovely."
6653,205,68,53,"What happened to you, ugly?"
6654,205,68,53,What's your name?
6655,205,68,1,Dudely.  Vernon Dudley.
6656,205,68,53,"Check the list.  And you, ginger?"
6657,205,68,2,Stan Shunpike.
6658,205,68,53,Like 'ell you are.  We know skinny Stan.  Try again.
6659,205,68,2,Weasley... Barney Weasley.
6660,205,68,53,"Weasley, eh?  Wouldn't be related to that blood traitor Arthur Weasley, would you?"
6661,205,68,2,Piss off!  Arthur Weasley's ten times the wizard you are!
6662,205,68,53,"Worth ten times you if I can find him.  Wasn't you that tipped him off, was it?"
6663,205,68,53,"How 'bout you, lovely?  What do they call you...?"
6664,205,68,3,Penelope Clearwater.  Half-blood.
6665,205,68,53,"You smell like vanilla, Penelope. I think you're going to be my favorite."
6666,205,68,145,There's no Vernon Dudley on 'ere.
6667,205,68,102,"Hear that, ugly?  The list says you're lying.  How come you don't want us to know who you are?  Hm?"
6668,205,68,1,The list is wrong.  I told you who I am --
6669,205,68,53,"Change of plans, boys.  We won't be taking this lot to the Ministry."
6670,205,68,1,What did you put on me?
6671,205,68,3,A Stinging Jinx.
6672,205,68,1,How long will it last?
6673,205,68,3,Not long.
6674,206,13,22,Show me. Get Draco. Well?
6675,206,13,12,I can't be sure.
6676,206,13,23,"Draco. Look closely, son. If we are the ones to hand Potter over to the Dark Lord... ...everything would be forgiven. All would be as it was, you understand?"
6677,206,13,53,"Now, we won't be forgetting who actually caught him, I hope, Mr. Malfoy."
6678,206,13,23,You dare to talk to me like that in my own house?
6679,206,13,22,"Lucius. Don't be shy, sweetie. Come over. Now, if this isn't who we think it is, Draco, and we call him, he'll kill us all. We need to be absolutely sure."
6680,206,13,12,What's wrong with his face?
6681,206,13,22,"Yes, what is wrong with his face?"
6682,206,13,145,"He came to us like that. Something he picked up in the forest, I reckon."
6683,206,13,22,"Or ran into a Stinging Jinx. Was it you, dearie? Give me her wand. We'll see what her last spell was. Ah. Got you. What is that? Where'd you get that from?"
6684,206,13,145,It was in her bag when we searched her. Reckon it's mine now. Are you mad? Go! Get out!
6685,206,13,22,"Cissy, put the boys in the cellar. I want to have a little conversation with this one, girl-to-girl."
6686,206,13,2,What are we gonna do? We can't leave Hermione alone with her.
6687,206,13,25,Ron? Harry?
6688,206,13,1,Luna?
6689,206,13,22,That sword is meant to be in my vault at Gringotts. How did you get it? What else did you and your friends take from my vault?!
6690,206,13,3,I didn't take anything. Please. I didn't take anything.
6691,206,13,22,I don't believe it.
6692,206,13,2,We have to do something.
6693,206,13,43,There's no way out of here. We've tried everything. It's enchanted.
6694,206,13,3,Please! please!
6695,206,13,22,Shut up!
6696,206,13,25,"You're bleeding, Harry. That's a curious thing to keep in your sock."
6697,206,13,1,Help us.
6698,206,13,2,Let her go.
6699,206,13,44,"Shut up. Get back. You, goblin, come with me."
6700,207,13,27,Aah!
6701,207,13,1,Dobby? What are you doing here?
6702,207,13,27,"Dobby has come to rescue Harry Potter, of course. Dobby will always be there for Harry Potter."
6703,207,13,1,You can Apparate in and out of this room? Could you take us with you?
6704,207,13,27,"Of course, sir. I'm an elf."
6705,207,13,2,Works for me.
6706,207,13,1,"Dobby, I want you to take Luna and Mr. Ollivander--"
6707,207,13,2,Shell Cottage on the outskirts of Tinworth. Trust me.
6708,207,13,25,"Whenever you're ready, sir."
6709,207,13,27,Sir? I like her very much. Meet me at the top of the stairs in 10 seconds.
6710,207,13,44,Ow.
6711,207,13,27,Who gets his wand?
6712,207,13,22,"I'm only going to ask you once more, goblin. Think very, very carefully before you answer."
6713,207,13,30,I don't know.
6714,207,13,22,You don't know? Why weren't you doing your job? Who got into my vault? Who stole it? Who stole it? Well?
6715,207,13,30,"When I was last in your vault, the sword was there. Oh, well then, perhaps it just walked out on its own then."
6716,207,13,30,There is no place safer than Gringotts.
6717,207,13,22,"Liar! Consider yourself lucky, goblin. The same won't be said for this one."
6718,207,13,2,Like hell.
6719,207,13,2,Expellliarmus!
6720,207,13,1,Stupefy.
6721,207,13,22,"Stop! Drop your wands. I said, drop them! Pick them up, Draco, now. Well, well, well, look what we have here. It's Harry Potter. He's all bright and shiny and new again, just in time for the Dark Lord. Call him. Call him."
6722,207,13,1,Stupefy!
6723,207,13,22,Stupid elf. You could've killed me.
6724,207,13,27,Dobby never meant to kill. Dobby only meant to maim or seriously injure.
6725,207,13,22,How dare you take a witch's wand? How dare you defy your masters?
6726,207,13,27,Dobby has no master. Dobby is a free elf. And Dobby has come to save Harry Potter and his friends.
6727,208,15,1,Hermione. You're all right. We're safe. We're all safe.
6728,208,15,27,Harry Potter.
6729,208,15,1,"Dobby. Dobby. No, just-- Hold on. Hold on. Look, just hold on, okay? We'll fix you. Hermione will have something. In your bag. Hermione? Hermione? What is it? Help me."
6730,208,15,27,Such a beautiful place... ...to be with friends. Dobby is happy to be with his friend... ...Harry Potter.
6731,208,15,25,We should close his eyes. Don't you think? There. Now he could be sleeping.
6732,208,15,1,I want to bury him. Properly. Without magic.
6733,209,15,25,It's beautiful here.
6734,209,15,73,"It was our Aunt's. We used to come here as kids. The Order uses it now as a safe house -- what's left of us, at least."
6735,209,15,25,Muggles think these keep evil away. But they're wrong...
6736,209,15,1,I need to talk to the goblin.
6737,210,15,1,How are you?
6738,210,15,30,Alive.
6739,210,15,1,You probably don't remember --
6740,210,15,1,Yes.
6741,210,15,30,And brought me here.
6742,210,15,30,You are a very unusual wizard.
6743,210,15,1,Why did you leave Gringotts?
6744,210,15,30,Soon the Death Eaters will control it. That was unacceptable to me.
6745,210,15,2,Then you're on our side.
6746,210,15,30,This is a wizard's war. I take no side.
6747,210,15,30,It is impossible.
6748,210,15,1,"Alone, yes. With you, no."
6749,210,15,30,How did you come by this sword?
6750,210,15,1,It's complicated. Why did Bellatrix Lestrange think it should be in her vault at Gringotts?
6751,210,15,30,It's complicated.
6752,210,15,1,The sword presented itself to us in a moment of need. We didn't steal it.
6753,210,15,30,"There is a sword in Madam Lestrange's vault identical to this one, but it is a fake. It was placed there this past summer."
6754,210,15,1,And she never suspected?
6755,210,15,30,The replica is very convincing. Only a goblin would recognize that this is the true Sword of Gryffindor.
6756,210,15,2,Who put it there? The fake.
6757,210,15,30,"It was not my place to ask, nor did I desire to. There are more than a few curious things in the vaults at Gringotts."
6758,210,15,1,And in Madam Lestrange's vault as well?
6759,210,15,30,Perhaps.
6760,210,15,30,I have no interest in gold.
6761,210,15,1,Then what? The goblin twists the curl at his chin... then his eyes
6762,210,15,30,That is my price.
6763,210,15,30,"I have your word, Harry Potter, that you will give me the Sword of Gryffindor if I help you?"
6764,210,15,3,"Harry, are you thinking there's a Horcrux in Bellatrix's vault?"
6765,210,15,1,"She was terrified when she thought we'd been in there. She kept asking you what else we'd taken. I'd bet anything there's a Horcrux there. If we find it, we can kill it. And if we kill it, we're one step closer to killing him."
6766,210,15,2,And if we find one? How're we supposed to destroy it if we've given Griphook the sword?
6767,210,15,1,I'm still working on that part.
6768,211,15,81,He's too weak.
6769,211,15,43,Forgive me if I don't get up.
6770,211,15,1,"Mr. Ollivander, I need to ask you a few questions."
6771,211,15,43,"Anything, m'boy, anything."
6772,211,15,1,"Can you identify these, sir?"
6773,211,15,43,Walnut and dragon heartstring. Twelve and three quarter inches. Unyielding. This belongs to Bellatrix Lestrange.
6774,211,15,1,And this?
6775,211,15,43,Hawthorn. Unicorn hair. Ten inches. Reasonably pliant. This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.
6776,211,15,1,Was? Isn't it still?
6777,211,15,43,Perhaps not -- if you won it from him. I sense its allegiance has changed.
6778,211,15,43,"The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. That much has always been clear to those of us who have studied wandlore."
6779,211,15,1,"What do you know about the Deathly Hallows, sir?"
6780,211,15,43,"There are rumored to be three: The Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone and the Invisibility Cloak. It is said that to possess them all is to make oneself the Master of Death. But few truly believe such objects exist --"
6781,211,15,1,"But you, sir? Do you believe they exist?"
6782,211,15,1,You're lying. You know one exists and you told him about it. You told him about the Elder Wand and where to go looking for it.
6783,211,15,43,"He tortured me! Besides, I conveyed only rumors. There's no guarantee he will find it --"
6784,211,15,1,"He has found it, sir."
6785,211,15,1,"That's all, sir. We'll leave you to get some rest now."
6786,211,15,43,"He's after you, Mr. Potter. If it's true, what you say, that he has the Elder Wand, I'm afraid you really don't stand a chance."
6787,211,15,1,"Then I guess I'll just have to kill him before he finds me, sir."
6788,211,15,2,You're sure it's hers?
6789,211,15,3,Positive. Harry turns to the two wands on the table -- the ones he showed Ollivander -- and extends the longest to Hermione.
6790,211,15,1,I reckon you should take this then.
6791,211,15,2,You heard Ollivander. It's Harry's now.
6792,211,15,3,But I hate that thing -- that's the wand that killed Sirius! How can I hold it and not feel...
6793,211,15,1,"If I can hold it, you can."
6794,211,15,2,"How will we know what it is when we get in there? After all, a Horcrux can be anything."
6795,211,15,1,I'll know. I can't explain. It's like...
6796,211,15,2,That's a bit scary.
6797,211,15,3,"It is, Harry. Did Dumbledore ever say anything to you, something that might explain why --"
6798,211,15,1,No. I just know. When one's near.
6799,211,15,81,"This is the closest I could find to what you described, Hermione."
6800,211,15,3,"It's perfect. Thank you, Fleur."
6801,211,15,73,"You're leaving, aren't you."
6802,211,15,1,In the morning.
6803,211,15,73,And Griphook?
6804,211,15,1,He'll be leaving too.
6805,211,15,73,"Listen, I don't know what you're up to, but I know goblins. If you've struck any kind of bargain with Griphook, you must be exceptionally careful to live up to it. If you don't... he won't be forgiving."
6806,211,15,25,The sky has lost a star.
6807,211,15,25,"My father used to say that when a child died. She looks up, smiles."
6808,211,15,1,"Yeah. Funny. Listen, Luna, about your father, I don't want you to think I --"
6809,211,15,25,"I know you understand why my father did what he did, Harry. That's why we don't need to talk about it."
6810,211,15,1,Hogwarts?
6811,211,15,1,"It's not the place you left, you"
6812,211,15,25,Neither am I.
6813,211,15,2,Always good value. I'll miss her.
6814,211,15,2,What d'you think?
6815,211,15,1,Wouldn't know you if I didn't know you.
6816,211,15,2,You want to tell me what that is?
6817,211,15,1,"Sirius gave it to me. He had a matching piece. He said if I ever needed him, all I had to do was look into it."
6818,211,15,2,You mean he could see you?
6819,211,15,1,Something like that. I don't know. He died before I ever got to use it. The thing is...
6820,211,15,2,Go on.
6821,211,15,1,"You'll think I'm mental, but more than once, when I've looked into it -- I think I've seen Dumbledore."
6822,211,15,2,Bloody hell... that's a sight.
6823,211,15,22,"Well, how do I look?"
6824,211,15,2,Hideous.
6825,211,15,22,"Oh dear, I missed a spot, didn't I? Hold still..."
6826,211,15,2,"Couldn't do anything about that bit in the back that's always flipping up, could you? Dead annoying --"
6827,211,15,2,"Never mind. I'm good.  That is you in there, isn't it?"
6828,211,15,1,"You can give that to Hermione to hold, all right, Griphook?"
6829,212,2,130,Madam Lestrange.
6830,212,2,30,"Good morning? Good morning? You're Bellatrix Lestrange, not some dewy-eyed schoolgirl!"
6831,212,2,2,Hey. Easy.
6832,212,2,30,She gives us away and we might as well use that sword to slit our own throats. Understand?
6833,212,2,3,He's right. I was being stupid.
6834,212,2,1,C'mon. Let's do it.
6835,212,2,130,Identification.
6836,212,2,22,I wish to enter my vault.
6837,212,2,130,"I see. Very well. Excuse me, won't you?"
6838,212,2,22,I don't like to be kept waiting.
6839,212,2,130,Next.
6840,212,2,22,He's with me.
6841,212,2,30,They know!
6842,212,2,2,What do you mean?
6843,212,2,30,They know she's an imposter! They've been warned!
6844,212,2,64,Madam Lestrange. Would you mind presenting your wand?
6845,212,2,22,And why should I do that?
6846,212,2,2,"Harry, what do we do? Harry...?"
6847,212,2,64,"It's the bank's policy. I'm sure you understand, given the current climate --"
6848,212,2,22,"No, I most certainly do not understand --"
6849,212,2,64,I'm afraid I must insist.
6850,212,2,1,Imperio.
6851,212,2,64,"Very well, Madam Lestrange. If you will follow me."
6852,212,2,130,"But... Bogrod, there have been special instructions regarding the Lestrange vault."
6853,212,2,64,I'm fully aware of that. I'm also aware the Lestranges are one of our oldest and most respected families.
6854,212,2,130,"Yes, sir, but our instructions are very specific --"
6855,212,2,64,"Let me be specific with you, Ricbert. I've run this bank for forty-five years, long before anyone had even heard of a Death Eater. The day may come that they feel they can run this place better than me, but that day has not yet arrived. Am I understood!"
6856,212,2,64,"Madam, if you will, I will escort you myself."
6857,212,2,1,How long before they come after us?
6858,212,2,2,What's that? Up ahead.
6859,212,2,30,I should have known --
6860,212,2,1,"What is that, Griphook?"
6861,212,2,1,Griphook! What is that!
6862,212,2,1,Well done. Hey.
6863,212,2,30,The Thief's Downfall. Washes away all enchantments. Can be deadly.
6864,212,2,2,You don't say.  Just out of interest... is there any other way out of here?
6865,212,2,30,No.
6866,212,2,64,What the devil are you all doing down here!
6867,212,2,30,We need him!
6868,212,2,64,"Is this your doing, Griphook? You have no rights here anymore. When you gave up your keys, you --"
6869,212,2,2,Imperio!
6870,212,2,30,Well done.
6871,212,2,2,No. It's not possible...
6872,212,2,2,Bloody hell. That's a Welsh Green.
6873,212,2,3,It looks like it's been down here forever.
6874,212,2,30,Go on.
6875,212,2,2,It's been trained to expect pain when it hears the noise.
6876,212,2,3,That's barbaric. I...
6877,212,2,30,We'll only have a few seconds. In other words... they'll be no do-
6878,212,2,30,"Ready, Bogrod?"
6879,212,2,64,Hm? Oh. Yes. Of course.
6880,212,2,1,Lumos !
6881,212,2,2,Lumos !
6882,212,2,3,Lumos !
6883,212,2,2,Blimey...
6884,212,2,3,Look.
6885,212,2,3,No wonder Bellatrix thought it was real.
6886,213,2,2,"Is it here, Harry? Can you feel anything?"
6887,213,2,3,"It's hot! All eyes turn to the bowl, WOBBLING MADLY on the floor, when... it SPLITS APART and begins to MULTIPLY."
6888,213,2,3,"Ron, your foot!"
6889,213,2,30,We'll be crushed! Hurry!
6890,213,2,1,That's it. Up there.
6891,213,2,3,How're we going to reach it?
6892,213,2,1,Give me the sword! The real one.
6893,213,2,2,Keep going!
6894,213,2,3,Harry! Behind you!
6895,213,2,2,The cup!
6896,213,2,3,In here!
6897,213,2,1,"We have a deal, Griphook."
6898,213,2,30,I said I'd get you in. I never said anything about getting you out.
6899,213,2,1,Griphook! Griphook!
6900,213,2,30,Thieves! Help! Thieves!
6901,214,2,2,Foul little git. Least we've got Bogrod.
6902,214,2,2,That's unfortunate.
6903,214,2,3,We can't just stand here! Who's got an idea?
6904,214,2,2,You're asking us? You're the brilliant one.
6905,214,2,3,I've got something. But it's mad.
6906,214,2,3,Relashio!
6907,214,2,2,That's your idea?
6908,214,2,1,Come on!
6909,214,2,3,It doesn't realize it's free!
6910,214,74,2,That was brilliant! BRILLIANT!
6911,214,74,2,Bloody hell.
6912,214,74,1,We're dropping!
6913,214,74,2,I say we jump!
6914,214,74,3,When?
6915,214,74,9,"The boy has discovered our secret, Nagini. We must find out just how much he knows. We must return to our hiding places and see if the others are safe."
6916,214,74,1,He knows.
6917,214,74,3,How is it you --
6918,214,74,1,I saw him.
6919,214,74,3,"You let him in! Harry, you can't --"
6920,214,74,1,"I can't always help it, Hermione!"
6921,214,74,2,Never mind! What did you see?
6922,214,74,1,He's angry. But he's scared too. He's going to make sure the other Horcruxes are safe.
6923,214,74,2,What happens when he finds out four are gone?
6924,214,74,1,I reckon he'll do anything to stop us from finding the rest. There's more: one of them's at Hogwarts.
6925,214,74,3,What?
6926,214,74,2,What?
6927,214,74,3,You saw it?
6928,214,74,3,Tonight? But we have to plan. We have to figure out what --
6929,214,74,1,"Honestly, Hermione, when have any of our plans actually worked? We plan, we get there and all hell breaks loose."
6930,214,74,2,'Fraid he's right. One problem: Snape's Headmaster now. We can't just walk in the front door.
6931,215,74,1,We'll go to Hogsmeade. To Honeydukes. Take the secret passage in the cellar.
6932,215,74,1,"There's something wrong with him. In the past, I could always follow his thoughts. Now everything feels disconnected."
6933,215,74,2,Maybe it's because of the Horcruxes. Maybe he's growing weaker. Maybe he's dying.
6934,215,74,1,"No. It's more like he's wounded. If anything, he feels more"
6935,215,21,3,They were ready for us.
6936,215,21,129,"We know you're here, Potter. There's no getting away."
6937,215,21,129,Perhaps you need some convincing.
6938,215,21,2,What's he mean by that?
6939,215,21,3,"No, you'll give us away."
6940,215,21,1,Expecto Patronum!
6941,216,21,40,"In here, Potter."
6942,216,21,2,Did you get a look at him! Fora second I thought it was --
6943,216,21,3,I know.
6944,216,21,3,Harry! I can see you! In here!
6945,216,21,40,You bloody fools! What were you thinking coming here? Do you have any idea how dangerous it is --
6946,216,21,1,You're Aberforth.
6947,216,21,1,Dumbledore's brother. It's you I've been seeing -- here. It's
6948,216,21,40,Where've you left him?
6949,216,21,1,He's dead.
6950,216,21,40,Sorry to hear it. I liked that elf.
6951,216,21,40,"Mundungus Fletcher, 'bout a year ago."
6952,216,21,1,Dung had no right selling you that. It belonged to --
6953,216,21,40,Sirius. Albus told me. He also told me that you'd likely be hacked off if you ever found out I had it. But ask yourself where you'd be if I didn't.
6954,216,21,40,"Right then. Reckon you're hungry. Let's get you fed, then think of the best way to get you out of here."
6955,216,21,3,Do you hear much from the others? From the Order?
6956,216,21,40,The Order is finished. You-Know- Who's won. Anyone who says otherwise is kidding themselves.
6957,216,21,1,We need to get into Hogwarts. Dumbledore gave us a job to do.
6958,216,21,40,Did he now? Nice job? Easy?
6959,216,21,1,We've been hunting Horcruxes. We think the last one's in the school. But we'll need your help getting in.
6960,216,21,1,"If we can find it and kill it, then we kill him, and then we can end this war once and for all. We need to get into Hogwarts tonight."
6961,216,21,40,"It's not a job my brother's given you, it's a suicide mission. Do yourself a favor boy. Go home. Live a little longer."
6962,216,21,1,"Dumbledore trusted me, to see this through."
6963,216,21,1,Why should he...
6964,216,21,40,Keep secrets? You tell me.
6965,216,21,1,I only care about the Dumbledore I knew. I trusted him.
6966,216,21,40,Did you now? And why is that?
6967,216,21,1,I had no reason not to --
6968,216,21,40,"That's a boy's answer. A boy who goes chasing Horcruxes on the word of a man who won't even tell him where to start. You're lying. Not just to me, which doesn't matter, but to yourself as well. That's what a fool does."
6969,216,21,1,You're drunk.
6970,216,21,40,"You don't strike me as a fool, Mr. Potter. So I'll ask you again. There must be a reason. Why do you trust anything my brother ever said to you? Why?"
6971,216,21,40,You know what to do...
6972,216,21,1,Where've you sent her?
6973,216,21,40,You'll see soon enough.
6974,216,21,3,"That's Ariana, isn't it? Your sister. She's beautiful."
6975,216,21,40,She'll always be beautiful.
6976,216,21,3,"She died very young, didn't she."
6977,216,21,40,"My brother sacrificed many things, Mr. Potter, in his journey to find power, including her. She was devoted to him -- he gave her everything, but time."
6978,216,21,3,Mr. Dumbledore... thank you.
6979,216,21,3,"Did save our lives twice. Kept an eye on us in that mirror. That doesn't seem like someone who's given up, does it?"
6980,216,21,3,She's coming back! And she's got someone with her!
6981,216,21,2,Who's that with her? Bloody hell...
6982,217,55,10,I knew you'd come! I told them alii! Harry Potter would never abandon Hogwarts!
6983,217,55,1,"Neville, you look..."
6984,217,55,10,Like hell? I reckon. This is nothing. Seamus is worse. You'll see. Hermione! Ron!
6985,217,55,10,"Hey, Ab. There might be a couple more people on the way."
6986,217,55,10,Well? Ready?
6987,217,55,2,I don't remember this being on the Marauder's Map.
6988,217,55,10,That's because it never existed till now. The seven secret passages were sealed off before the start of the year. This is the only way in or out now. The grounds are crawling with Death Eaters and Dementors.
6989,217,55,3,"How bad is it, Neville? With Snape as Headmaster."
6990,217,55,10,Hardly ever see him. It's the Carrows you have to watch out for.
6991,217,55,1,The Carrows?
6992,217,55,10,"Brother and sister. They're in charge of discipline. Like punishment, the Carrows."
6993,217,55,3,They did that to you? But why?
6994,217,55,10,Today's Dark Arts lesson had us practicing the Cruciatus Curse. On First Years. I refused. Hogwarts has changed.
6995,217,55,10,"Aw, c'mon. Don't be grim. We're all used to it by now. And the thing is, it helps when people stand up, gives everyone hope. I used to notice that when you did it, Harry. C'mon, we're almost there."
6996,217,55,10,"Let's have a bit of fun, shall we?  Hey! Listen up, you lot! I've brought you a surprise!"
6997,217,55,29,Blimey.
6998,217,55,10,Get the word out to Remus and the others that Harry's back.
6999,217,55,111,"River, DA calling. Do you read? We have a new weather report: Lightning has struck. I repeat, lightning has struck..."
7000,217,55,10,"Okay, okay! Stand down! lLet's not kill them before You-Know-Who gets the chance!"
7001,217,55,1,"Okay. There's something we need to find, something hidden here in the castle. It could help us defeat You-Know-Who."
7002,217,55,10,What is it?
7003,217,55,1,We don't know.
7004,217,55,75,Where is it?
7005,217,55,1,I realize it's not much to go on.
7006,217,55,29,That's nothing to go on.
7007,217,55,1,"I think it might have something to do with Ravenclaw. It would be small, easy to conceal, valuable. Any ideas?"
7008,217,55,25,"Well, there's Rowena Ravenclaw's lost diadem."
7009,217,55,25,The lost diadem of Ravenclaw? Hasn't anyone ever heard of it? It's quite famous.
7010,217,55,55,"Yes, but Luna, it's lost. For centuries now. There's not a person alive today who's seen it."
7011,217,55,2,Excuse me. But would someone tell me: what's a bloody diadem?
7012,217,55,55,"It's a kind of crown. You know, like a tiara."
7013,217,55,55,"Ravenclaw's was rumored to have magical properties, to enhance the wisdom of the wearer."
7014,217,55,20,Harry.
7015,217,55,1,"Hey there. Ron smiles, about to speak, then notices Ginny's eyes have not left Harry. He frowns, speaks to Hermione."
7016,217,55,2,"Six months she hasn't seen me and it's like I'm Frankie First Year. I mean, I'm only her brother."
7017,217,55,29,"Got loads of those, though, doesn't she? There's only one Harry."
7018,217,55,2,"Shut up, Seamus."
7019,217,55,10,"What is it, Ginny?"
7020,217,55,20,Snape knows. He knows that Harry was spotted in Hogsmeade.
7021,217,55,120,"Put a smile on, Miss Reynolds. Wouldn't want me to have to pay a visit to Daddy again, would you?"
7022,218,36,6,Many of you are surely wondering why I have summoned you here at this hour. It has come to my attention that earlier this evening... Harry Potter was sighted in Hogsmeade.
7023,218,36,6,I mention this in the hopes that truth will not be supplanted by
7024,218,36,6,"For myself and a few select members of the staff this comes as little surprise. We have, for some time, considered Mr. Potter's return to Hogwarts to be not only possible but inevitable. Consequently, in the past several months and under my specific direction, exhaustive defensive strategies have been employed to defeat any attempt Mr. Potter might make to breach these walls. But know this. Should anyone -- student or staff -- attempt to aid Mr. Potter, that person will be punished in a manner consistent with the severity of their transgression. Rest assured: So long as I am Headmaster at Hogwarts, Harry Potter will never again step foot in this castle."
7025,218,36,6,Now then. If anyone here has knowledge of Mr. Potter's movements this evening... I invite them to step forward now.
7026,218,36,1,I think I can help you out with that... -.. Harry appears.
7027,218,36,1,And I'm afraid it's rather extensive.
7028,218,36,1,How dare you stand where he stood.
7029,218,36,1,"Tell them how it was that night. Tell then how you looked him in the eye, a man who trusted you... and killed him. Tell them!"
7030,218,36,1,I'm a Gryffindor.
7031,218,36,9,I know that many of you will want to fight. Some of you may even think this wise. But this is foily.
7032,218,36,9,I wish you no harm. TI have great respect for the students of Hogwarts. I was once one myself after all. I ask for but one thing and if granted no magical blood shail be spiit...
7033,218,36,9,Give me Harry Potter. Do this and none shall be harmed. Give me Harry Potter and I shail leave Hogwarts untouched. Give me Harry Potter and you will be rewarded.
7034,218,36,91,But he's there! Potter's there! Someone grab him!
7035,218,36,35,Students out of bed! Students in the corridors!
7036,218,36,35,"Oh. Sorry, mum."
7037,218,36,35,Right away.
7038,219,36,1,Time. As much as you can give me.
7039,219,36,1,"Is that possible, Professor?"
7040,219,36,1,I think you're right.
7041,219,36,1,"You, too, Professor."
7042,219,66,10,"Let me get this straight, Professor. You're giving us permission to do this?"
7043,219,66,10,To blow it up. Boom.
7044,219,66,10,Wicked.
7045,219,66,29,I can bring 'er down.
7046,219,66,59,"You realize, of course, that nothing we do will be able to keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely."
7047,219,66,79,That doesn't mean we can't hold him up.
7048,219,66,166,Protego Maxima... Finato Duri... Repello Inimicum...
7049,219,66,2,"Harry, Hermione and I have been thinking. It doesn't really matter if we find the Horcrux."
7050,219,66,3,Unless we can destroy it.
7051,219,66,2,So we were thinking --
7052,219,66,3,You were thinking. It's Ron's idea. And it's brilliant.
7053,219,66,2,"You destroyed Tom Riddle's Diary with a Basilisk fang, right? Well, we know where we might find one, don't we?"
7054,219,66,1,Okay. But take this. That way you can find me when you get back.
7055,219,66,3,Where are you going?
7056,220,66,1,"Ravenclaw Common Room. Got to start somewhere. Hermione nods, slips the Map in her beaded bag and she and Ron head off. Just before they turn the corner, Ron looks back, holds Harry's glance briefly... and then is"
7057,220,53,25,Harry! Wait! I need to talk to
7058,220,53,1,"I'm a bit preoccupied right now, Luna."
7059,220,53,1,"We'll talk later, Luna."
7060,220,53,25,Harry --
7061,220,53,1,Later.
7062,220,53,25,Don't you remember what Cho said about Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem: 'There's not a person alive who's seen it.'
7063,220,53,25,"It's obvious, isn't it? We have to talk to someone who's dead."
7064,220,53,25,"He's very impressive, isn't he?"
7065,221,53,9,They never learn. Such a pity.
7066,221,53,9,Begin.
7067,221,53,96,"But, my Lord, shouldn't we wait --"
7068,221,53,14,Nice night for it!
7069,221,53,1,"Okay, Luna. Who've you got in mind?"
7070,221,29,29,That's it. I want a charge on each and every joist.
7071,221,29,10,"You do know what you're doing, don't you, Seamus?"
7072,221,29,10,Blimey.
7073,221,29,10,Not good.
7074,221,53,25,"If you're to find her, you'll find her down there."
7075,221,53,25,No. I think it best if you two talk alone. She's very shy.
7076,221,66,56,Tell Professor McGonagall Remus and I will handle this side of the castle.
7077,221,66,75,"Yes, sir."
7078,221,66,56,Dean!
7079,221,66,11,"It's the quality of one's conviction that determines success, not the number of one's followers."
7080,221,66,56,Who said that?
7081,221,66,11,Me.
7082,221,66,11,Speaking of quality.
7083,221,66,11,You shouldn't have. It's Teddy who needs you.
7084,221,66,61,He'll sleep 'til dawn and snore like his father. It's you who needs me tonight.
7085,221,29,1,It's you...
7086,221,29,10,Ha! dal
7087,221,29,10,Yeah! You and whose army!
7088,221,29,29,Woah! Easy up there!
7089,221,29,10,Sorry.
7090,221,25,2,Harry talks in his sleep. Haven't you noticed?
7091,221,25,3,No. Of course not.
7092,221,25,2,I've never got this far before.
7093,221,25,3,I'm scared.
7094,221,25,2,Me too. Hermione: I didn't expect it to be like this.
7095,221,25,3,Not this.
7096,222,53,1,"You're the Grey Lady, the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower."
7097,222,53,54,I do not answer to that name.
7098,222,53,1,"I'm sorry. It's Helena, isn't it? Helena Ravenclaw. Rowena's daughter. Luna told me."
7099,222,53,54,Are you a friend of Luna's?
7100,222,53,1,Yes. She thought you might be able to help me.
7101,222,53,54,You seek my mother's diadem.
7102,222,53,1,Yes! That's right --
7103,222,53,54,"Luna is kind. Unlike so many of the others, but she was wrong. I cannot help you."
7104,222,53,1,Wait! Please!
7105,222,53,54,Many have sought my mother's diadem. Its powers are
7106,222,53,1,But I don't care about its powers! Honestly --
7107,222,53,1,I don't seek it for myself! You have to believe me!
7108,222,53,1,I want to destroy it.
7109,222,53,1,"That's what you want, isn't it, Helena? You want it destroyed."
7110,222,53,54,"But I only wanted to be more like her, clever and wise. She wore it so beautifully, but on me... I grew to hate it... the pain I felt... the pain I feel even now..."
7111,222,53,1,"I'll end your pain, Helena. Tell me where it is and I'll destroy it, I swear, on my mother's memory --"
7112,222,53,54,"Another swore to destroy it, many years ago, a strange boy with a strange name..."
7113,222,53,1,Tom Riddle --
7114,222,53,54,But he lied.
7115,222,53,1,He's lied to many people --
7116,222,53,54,I know what he's done! I know who he is! He defiled it! With Dark Magic!
7117,222,53,54,Strange... you remind me of him a bit...
7118,222,53,54,It's here. In the castle. In the
7119,222,53,54,"If you have to ask, you'll never know. If you know, you need only ask..."
7120,222,53,1,Thank you... -.. then turning...
7121,222,53,1,Thank you... -.. then running.
7122,223,25,2,You do it.
7123,223,25,2,"Yes, you can."
7124,223,29,10,Not good.
7125,223,29,20,Ready!?
7126,223,29,10,Are you bloody joking?!
7127,223,29,29,He's good...
7128,223,29,29,He's good...
7129,223,29,20,What?
7130,223,29,10,That was kind of exciting. Seamus grins and winks knowingly. Ginny shakes her head.
7131,223,29,20,Mad. The both of you.
7132,223,29,10,Not good.
7133,223,29,35,Night-tee night.
7134,223,66,91,"You let us out of here, you filthy squib!"
7135,223,66,1,Ginny! Neville! You alright?
7136,223,66,10,"Never better! Feel like I could spit fire! Haven't seen Luna, have you?"
7137,223,66,1,Luna -- ?
7138,223,66,10,"I'm mad for her! Think it's about time I told her, seeing as there's a pretty good chance we'll both be dead by dawn!"
7139,223,66,20,I know.
7140,223,66,2,Bloody hell. We/'ll never find him on this.
7141,223,66,3,There he is.
7142,223,66,2,Brilliant.
7143,223,66,3,He vanished. Just now. I saw it. Ron glances at MAP -- then:
7144,223,66,3,That's right. I did.
7145,223,66,2,Let's go.
7146,223,66,3,Brilliant.
7147,223,55,12,Take my hand.
7148,223,55,12,"Well, well, what brings you here, Potter? Harry looks slowly over his shoulder. Draco -- Blaise and Goyle at his side -- steps INTO VIEW, his face bisected by light. He holds a wand on Harry."
7149,223,55,1,I could ask you the same.
7150,223,55,12,I virtually lived here last year. Remember?
7151,223,55,1,I remember.
7152,223,55,1,What's wrong with the one you have?
7153,223,55,12,Easy.
7154,223,55,1,Why didn't you tell her?
7155,223,55,1,Bellatrix. You knew it was me. But you didn't say anything.
7156,223,55,12,Give me my wand.
7157,223,55,1,No. I don't think so...
7158,223,55,1,"Besides, its allegiance is to me now. If you want it, you'll have to win it back. Perhaps even kill me..."
7159,223,55,99,"C'mon, Draco. Don't be a prat."
7160,223,55,99,Avada Kedavra!
7161,223,55,1,Expelliarmus!
7162,223,55,3,Did you see where it went? The diadem!
7163,223,55,1,Well done. Let's find Ron and get out of here.
7164,223,55,2,RUN! Goyle's set the bioody place on fire!
7165,223,55,1,Split up!
7166,223,55,3,Do we climb!
7167,223,55,1,"No, it''ll just follow us!"
7168,223,55,1,Here! Take one!
7169,223,55,2,Serves him right.
7170,223,55,3,C'mon! This way!
7171,223,55,1,Wait! What about Malfoy and Blaise!
7172,223,55,2,Brilliant.
7173,223,55,9,Nagini. Come.
7174,223,55,2,You're bloody well welcome!
7175,223,55,1,"Ron, you once asked me if I thought he felt it -- Voldemort -- when we destroy a Horcrux, when we destroy a piece of his soul."
7176,223,55,1,He does.
7177,223,55,1,It's the snake. She's the last one. The last Horcrux.
7178,223,55,2,Where will he take her?
7179,223,55,3,Someplace safe.
7180,223,55,1,No. He'll keep her close.
7181,223,55,2,"Look inside him, Harry."
7182,223,55,2,"Find out where he is. If we find him, we find the snake. Then we're one step closer to ending this."
7183,224,24,9,Stop looking at her. She smells your fear. It agitates her. Be grateful she's just eaten.
7184,224,24,23,"Forgive me, my Lord, but wouldn't it be more prudent to call off this battle and seek the boy yourself?"
7185,224,24,9,"I do not need to seek the boy! Before the night is out, he will come to me! Do you understand!"
7186,224,24,23,"Of c-course, my Lord."
7187,224,24,9,"How do you live with yourself, Lucius?  Go. Find Severus. Tell him I need to see him immediately."
7188,224,24,1,I know where he is.
7189,224,24,38,"There's more to me than incense and tea leaves, Mr. Finnegan."
7190,224,24,25,Thanks.
7191,224,24,10,Don't mention it.
7192,224,24,9,Why doesn't it work for me?
7193,224,24,6,"You have performed extraordinary magic with this wand, my Lord. In the last few hours alone --"
7194,224,24,9,No! I am extraordinary! But the wand resists me!
7195,224,24,6,"There is no wand more powerful. Ollivander himself said it. Tonight, when the boy comes to you, it will not fail you, I am sure. It answers to you and you only."
7196,224,24,9,Does it?
7197,224,24,6,My Lord?
7198,224,24,9,The wand. Does it truly answer to me?
7199,224,24,9,"You're a clever man, Severus. Surely you must know."
7200,224,24,9,"Where, Severus? Where does its loyalty lie?"
7201,224,24,6,"With you, of course, my Lord."
7202,224,24,9,"The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly, Severus, because I am"
7203,224,24,9,"The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner. Ollivander was quite explicit about that. You killed Dumbledore, Severus. While you live, the Elder Wand cannot be truly mine."
7204,224,24,6,My Lord --
7205,224,24,9,"You have been a good and faithful servant, Severus."
7206,224,24,9,But only I can live forever...
7207,224,24,9,Kill.
7208,224,24,9,Nagini! Come!
7209,225,24,6,Take them...
7210,225,24,6,Take them!
7211,225,24,6,Please.
7212,225,24,1,Give me something! Quickly! A flask! Anything.
7213,225,24,6,They are the same...
7214,225,24,6,You have your mother's eyes...
7215,225,24,2,He's gone. The snake too.
7216,225,24,9,You have fought valiantly... but in vain. I do not wish this. Every drop of magical bliood
7217,225,24,9,"I therefore command my forces to retreat. In their absence, dispose of your dead with dignity. Treat your injured."
7218,225,24,2,Never! Do you hear me! NEVER!
7219,225,24,3,Where is everyone?
7220,225,48,6,Lily... Then...
7221,225,48,32,Lily! Come out of there! Now!
7222,225,48,32,We're going home.
7223,225,48,6,She's jealous. Because she's ordinary and you're special.
7224,225,48,45,That's mean.
7225,225,48,6,It's true. You know so yourself.
7226,225,48,6,No! Don't kill me!
7227,225,48,4,That wasn't my intention.
7228,225,48,4,"Stand up, Severus. I haven't much time. What message do you bring from Lord Voldemort this time?"
7229,225,48,4,Is this about the Prophecy?
7230,225,48,6,Yes.
7231,225,48,4,How much did you relay?
7232,225,48,6,Only what I heard. But now... he thinks it refers to her.
7233,225,48,4,The Prophecy did not refer to a woman. It spoke of a boy born at the end of July --
7234,225,48,6,Yes! But he thinks it's her son! He intends to hunt them down now! To kill them!
7235,225,48,4,"If she means so much to you, surely Lord Voldemort would spare her in exchange for the boy."
7236,225,48,6,I have asked.
7237,225,48,4,You disgust me. You would sacrifice the life of an innocent child over a schoolboy crush?
7238,225,48,6,She's more than that! She's different! Beautiful. Kind.
7239,225,48,4,"And should I do so, what will you give me in return, Severus?"
7240,225,48,6,Anything.
7241,225,48,6,You said you would keep her safe!
7242,225,48,4,"Lily and James put their faith in the wrong person. Rather like you, Severus."
7243,225,48,4,The boy survives.
7244,225,48,4,He has her eyes.
7245,225,48,6,He doesn't need protection. The Dark Lord has gone --
7246,225,48,4,The Dark Lord will return. And the boy will be in terrible danger when he does.
7247,225,48,6,No one can know. Your word.
7248,225,48,4,"My word that I shall never reveal the best of you, Severus? If you insist."
7249,225,48,6,He exhibits no measurable talent. His arrogance rivals even his father's. And he seems to relish his fame.
7250,225,48,4,"Sometimes we see what we expect to see, Severus. Other teachers indicate the boy is modest, likeable and while no prodigy, possesses above-average gifts. Personally, I find him rather engaging."
7251,225,48,6,You see what you want to see.
7252,225,48,4,Perhaps. oOh. Severus.
7253,225,48,6,Why did you put it on? Surely you realized it carried a curse.
7254,225,48,4,I was... foolish... greedy...
7255,225,48,6,Drink the rest. It will contain the curse to the hand for the time being.
7256,225,48,4,For the time being?
7257,225,48,6,It will spread.
7258,225,48,4,How long?
7259,225,48,6,Maybe a year.
7260,225,48,4,"Well, this makes matters much more straightforward."
7261,225,48,4,"Do not ignore me, Severus. Was it not you who told me of Lord Voldemort's plan to have the Malfoy boy murder me?"
7262,225,48,6,It is not expected that he will succeed.
7263,225,48,4,You must agree.
7264,225,48,4,"Yes. You must be the one to kill me, Severus. It is the only way. Only then will the Dark Lord trust you completely."
7265,225,48,6,You ask too much.
7266,225,48,4,There will come a time when Harry Potter must be told something. But you must wait until Voldemort is at his most vulnerable.
7267,225,48,6,Tell him what?
7268,225,48,4,"On the night Lord Voldemort went to Godric's Hollow to kill Harry, and Lily Potter cast herself between them, the curse rebounded. When that happened, a part of Lord Voldemort's soul latched itself onto the only living thing it could find: Harry himself."
7269,225,48,4,There's a reason Harry can speak with snakes. There's a reason he can look into Lord Voldemort's mind. A part of Lord Voldemort lives inside him.
7270,225,48,6,"So when the time comes, the boy must die."
7271,225,48,6,You've kept him alive so that he can die at the proper moment. You've been raising him like a pig for slaughter.
7272,225,48,4,"But this is touching, Severus. Don't tell me you've grown to care for the boy?"
7273,225,48,6,Expecto Patronum!
7274,225,48,4,Lily. After all this time?
7275,225,48,6,Always... We GO TO BLACK...
7276,225,48,4,"The irony of course, Severus, is that -- in the end -- you and the boy desire the same thing..."
7277,226,33,3,Where've you been?
7278,226,33,2,"We thought you'd gone to the forest, we thought you might be --"
7279,226,33,1,I'm going there now.
7280,226,33,2,Are you mad! No!
7281,226,33,1,It's... meant to be.
7282,226,33,2,"Rubbish! You can't just give yourself up to him -- Hermione squeezes Ron's arm, silencing him."
7283,226,33,3,"What is it, Harry? What is it you"
7284,226,33,1,There's a reason I can... hear them -- the Horcruxes.
7285,226,33,1,I think I've known for awhile.
7286,226,33,3,I'll go with you. I/'ll --
7287,226,33,1,Kill the snake. Kill the snake and then it's just him. Then it will be over.
7288,226,33,46,I'll take him from here.
7289,226,33,20,It's all right. We're going to get you inside.
7290,226,35,131,I kept calling. No one came.
7291,226,35,20,Don't worry. I won't leave you. I promise.
7292,227,35,45,"You've been so brave, sweetheart."
7293,227,35,1,Why are you here? All of you?
7294,227,35,45,"We never left, dear."
7295,227,35,1,Does it hurt? Dying?
7296,227,35,18,Quicker than falling asleep.
7297,227,35,11,And he will want it to be quick.
7298,227,35,42,"You're nearly there, son."
7299,227,35,1,"I'm sorry. I didn't want any of you to die for me. And Remus, your son..."
7300,227,35,11,Others will tell him what his mother and father died for. Someday he'll understand...
7301,227,35,1,You'll stay with me?
7302,227,35,42,Until the end.
7303,227,35,1,He won't be able to see you?
7304,227,35,18,"No. We're here, you see."
7305,227,35,1,Stay close to me.
7306,227,35,45,Always...
7307,228,35,70,"No sign of him, my Lord."
7308,228,35,9,"I thought he would come. I was, it seems... mistaken."
7309,228,35,1,You weren't.
7310,228,35,70,Quiet!
7311,228,35,9,Harry Potter. The Boy Who Lived. Come to die. Nagini HISSES behind her protective guard of Death Eaters. Harry's gaze shifts to her when Voldemort raises
7312,229,71,4,You cannot help.
7313,229,71,4,"Harry. You wonderful boy. You brave, brave man. Let us walk."
7314,229,71,1,"Sir, this, is this... I mean, forgive me, but you are dead, aren't you, sir?"
7315,229,71,4,"Oh, yes."
7316,229,71,1,Then... I'm dead too?
7317,229,71,1,Not?
7318,229,71,4,Not.
7319,229,71,1,But I didn't defend myself. I let him kill me.
7320,229,71,1,"It's true, isn't it, sir? A bit of him lives in me, doesn't it?"
7321,229,71,4,Did. It was just destroyed only moments ago by none other than Voldemort himself.
7322,229,71,4,"You were the seventh Horcrux, Harry; the Horcrux he never meant to make."
7323,229,71,1,And you knew this? That's why you were certain I wouldn't die?
7324,229,71,4,"Certain? No. Little is certain in this world, Harry. Call it an educated guess."
7325,229,71,1,"Professor, is that -- ?"
7326,229,71,1,"Exactly where are we, sir?"
7327,229,71,4,I was going to ask you that. Where would you say that we are?
7328,229,71,1,It looks like King's Cross station -- only a lot cleaner. And without the trains.
7329,229,71,4,"King's Cross! Is that right? Well, this is, as they say, your party."
7330,229,71,1,"Sir, why didn't you just tell me about the Deathly Hallows?"
7331,229,71,4,"You will have to forgive me, Harry. You see... I didn't trust"
7332,229,71,4,"I feared that you would make the same mistake I made, that you would be intoxicated by the power the Hallows promise their possessor. But I crave your pardon, Harry. It's clear to me now, as it should have been all along, that you are the better man."
7333,229,71,1,Sir --
7334,229,71,4,"You are the worthy possessor of the Hallows, Harry, not me. I was fit to own the Elder Wand, because I took it not for gain, but to save others from it. But I took the Stone because I longed to recall someone who has long been at peace and for that I paid with my life."
7335,229,71,1,"You wanted to see Ariana again, didn't you, sir?"
7336,229,71,4,Yes.
7337,229,71,1,"I used the Stone as well, sir, only a little while ago when I entered the Forest. I saw my mum and dad, and Sirius and Lupin..."
7338,229,71,4,True. But ask yourself this: were you calling them? Or were they calling you?
7339,229,71,1,"I've got to go back, haven't I?"
7340,229,71,4,That is up to you.
7341,229,71,1,I've got a choice?
7342,229,71,4,"Oh yes. We are in King's Cross, you say? I think, should you so decide, you would be able to, let's say, board a train."
7343,229,71,1,And where would it take me?
7344,229,71,4,On.
7345,229,71,1,Voldemort's got the Elder Wand.
7346,229,71,4,True.
7347,229,71,1,And the snake lives.
7348,229,71,4,Yes.
7349,229,71,1,And I've nothing to kill it with.
7350,229,71,4,'Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.'
7351,229,71,4,"I have always prized my ability to turn a phrase -- words are, in my"
7352,229,71,1,"With all due respect, sir, I think what we need here is a miracle."
7353,229,71,4,"I've never put much stock in miracles, Harry. On the other hand, I can attest wholly to the extensive advantages of a related phenomenon."
7354,229,71,1,"Which would be, sir?"
7355,229,71,4,Luck.
7356,229,71,4,"Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living and, above all, those who live without love."
7357,229,71,1,"Sir, my mother's Patronus. It was a doe, wasn't it? Just like Professor Snape's. Curious, don't you think?"
7358,229,71,4,"Actually, if I think about it... it doesn't seem curious at all."
7359,229,71,1,Professor.
7360,229,71,1,Is this real? Or has this been happening inside my head?
7361,229,71,4,"Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry. But why should that mean that it is not real?"
7362,229,35,22,"My lord, let me help you --"
7363,229,35,9,I do not require assistance.
7364,229,35,22,The boy. Is he dead?
7365,229,35,63,Is he alive? Draco?
7366,229,66,128,"Don't despair, Longbottom. I put you in Gryffindor for good reason..."
7367,229,66,20,Who's that?
7368,229,66,20,... Hagrid's carrying?
7369,229,66,20,"Neville, who is that?"
7370,229,66,16,"What's going on here, Neville?"
7371,229,66,9,"Behold, Nagini. Our work is done."
7372,230,66,20,No... NO!
7373,230,66,9,Stupid girl. You cry for that?
7374,230,66,9,"While your hands ran dark with the blood of mothers and sons, fathers and daughters, brothers and sisters, his were clasped in prayer -- but it was a prayer for one and one only. While you battled courageously, until you could no longer will yourself to stand, he had long since fallen to his knees. While you cursed me until your voices grew ragged, he begged me for mercy in a voice as meek as a child's."
7375,230,66,9,So do not cry for that. He's not worthy of your tears. And do not despair of his betrayal. You were never in his heart. Not for one single solitary beat.
7376,230,66,2,Liar!
7377,230,66,9,"Did you not hear me! Harry Potter is dead! From this day forward, you put your faith in me or suffer the consequences. HARRY POTTER Is"
7378,230,66,9,Now is the time to declare yourself.
7379,230,66,23,Draco...
7380,230,66,23,"Draco, don't be stupid --"
7381,230,66,63,"Come, Draco."
7382,230,66,2,He saved your life.
7383,230,66,9,"Well done, Draco. Who will be next? Hm? Come now, don't be shy."
7384,231,66,9,"Well, I must say, I'd hoped for better. Is this truly the best Hogwarts has to offer?"
7385,231,66,9,"Who might you be, young man?"
7386,231,66,10,Neville Longbottom.
7387,231,66,9,"Well, welcome, Neville. I'm sure we can find a place for you in our ranks."
7388,231,66,22,Someone has to do the washing.
7389,231,66,9,"Now, now, Bellatrix. Let's not underestimate our young friend. By stepping forward, he lives to see another day..."
7390,231,66,10,I'd like to say something.
7391,231,66,9,"Very well, Neville. I'm sure we'd all be fascinated to hear what you have to say."
7392,231,66,10,It doesn't matter that Harry is gone. A troubled MURMUR ripples through the crowd.
7393,231,66,10,This isn't over.
7394,231,66,12,Potter! Harry turns. Draco's hand whips forward and -- to Harry's shock -- tosses him his wand. Ron GRINS.
7395,231,66,2,"Well done, Malfoy!"
7396,231,66,1,Confringo!
7397,231,66,1,The snake! We've got to kill the snake!
7398,231,66,10,Harry! Look out!
7399,231,66,9,Nagini! With me!
7400,231,66,9,Leave her!
7401,231,66,9,I said LEAVE HER!
7402,231,66,9,Nagini
7403,231,66,9,Die! Die
7404,231,66,9,Why do you live!
7405,232,66,1,Because I have something worth living for.
7406,232,66,1,Confringo!
7407,232,66,22,"Come on, granny, give us your best."
7408,232,66,26,"Back off, boys! She's mine!  You will never touch my chiidren again!"
7409,232,66,22,Be thankful we only took one. Besides...
7410,232,66,2,Hermione!
7411,232,66,3,Yes!
7412,232,66,3,I don't want you to say anything you wouldn't say if we weren't about to be killed by a giant snake! It'll just ruin it!
7413,233,66,1,You were right.
7414,233,66,1,When you told Professor Snape it was failing you. It will always fail you.
7415,233,66,9,It belongs to me! I killed Snape!
7416,233,66,1,Together.
7417,233,66,3,What's the matter with her?
7418,233,66,38,"There's more to me than incense and tea leaves, Mr. Finnegan."
7419,233,66,1,I told you: it's useless to you.
7420,233,66,2,"Not exactly leaving the place better than we found it, are we?"
7421,233,66,3,Can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs.
7422,233,66,3,Something my mum used to say.
7423,233,66,3,Why didn't it work for him? The Elder wand.
7424,233,66,1,Because it answers to another.
7425,233,66,1,"When he killed Snape, he thought the wand would become his. But the thing is... it never belonged to Snape."
7426,233,66,2,But that means...
7427,233,66,1,It answers to me.
7428,233,66,2,What do you reckon we should do with it?
7429,233,66,3,We?
7430,233,66,1,"Well, it wasn't boring, was it?"
7431,234,71,1,Together?
7432,234,71,3,Don't forget to give Professor Longbottom our best.
7433,234,71,84,Will there really be thestrals pulling the carriages?
7434,234,71,1,"There's nothing scary about thestrals. They're gentle things. Anyway, you won't be going up to school in the carriages. You/'be going in the boats, remember?"
7435,234,71,84,Dad?
7436,234,71,1,Yes?
7437,234,71,84,What if I'm put in Slytherin?
7438,234,71,1,Albus Severus Potter. You were named after two Headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin. And he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.
7439,234,71,84,But just say I am --
7440,234,71,1,"Then Slytherin House will have gained a wonderful wizard. But listen, if it means so much to you, you can choose Gryffindor. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account."
7441,234,71,84,Really?
7442,234,71,1,Really.
7443,234,71,1,Ready?
7444,234,71,84,Ready.
